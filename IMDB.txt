This is actually Star Wars
iix-3142212 November 2019
This is great. It looks like Star Wars. It's shot like Star Wars and it feels like Star Wars. The Speedster shot at the beginning of the episode brought me back to "A new hope". Filmed in the same fashion. I would take this over any of the last 6 movies. They are actually doing Star Wars stuff in the Star Wars universe. A+

How to actually subvert expectations.
burns-v223 November 2019
After singlehandedly starting the mcu, Jon Favreau saves star wars with his brilliant story telling. Write this man a blank check and take control of Lucasfilm already.

The vibe is finally right
jonahetheredge12 November 2019
This is the Star Wars atmosphere and feeling I've been waiting for. No dumb humor, cool characters, and a story I can take seriously. I'm a big fan of what they've done with this series so far and current Star Wars filmmakers need to take notes. The cinematography is amazing. You can tell they use practicality as much as possible and CGI is used only for the obvious like spaceships and creatures etc. It's a truly remarkable balance of old and new.

Dave Filoni & Jon Favreau are the future of Star Wars
directorseaich12 November 2019
What an incredible leap into Live Action Star Wars television. The Mandalorian delivers in both capturing the feel of the classic trilogy as well as it's own unique identity. A sweet spot of western/ sci fi/ action and comedy. Many Star Wars fans have experienced the expertly crafted stories by Filoni in series like "The Clone Wars" and "Rebels". His influence shines bright in The Mandalorian and I believe Star Wars fans will be absolutely thrilled to see his expertise once again bring excitement and wonder back to a Galaxy Far Far Away.

The Mandalorian - Now THIS is Star Wars
vanja-pletikosic16 November 2019
This show is such a refreshing breeze of great quality Star Wars. Hopefully with Episode 9, this horrible era of Star Wars will end, and we will finally get what we all wanted the whole time - great stories set in the Star Wars universe. Stories like this, that make sense. Stories that hook us and make us want more, make us relate to the characters on the screen, just by showing their weaknesses along with their strengths. The Mandalorian has faced more adversity in these two episodes than Rey has in two three hour movies. Definitely my favorite character of the Disney Star Wars era, and he has only said a few lines. Brilliant directing, brilliant script, brilliant execution of everything. I can't wait to see where the story goes.

John Favreau you have my gratitude and respect!

Can the real Star Wars please stand up!

Finally, this feels like the Star Wars universe. The cinematography, the atmosphere, the story line, wow! My only negative is, the episodes are too short.

So far so good
MarkoutTV12 November 2019
I like that they gave the Mandalorian some personality, some good vistas and action setpieces, solid comedy, fun little additions to the Star Wars canon (bounty droids are officially awesome) and a general sense of adventure that I dig. It's all very small and big at the same time. All good stuff and I hope they can keep it up.

I especially appreciate the fact they employed the services of Carl Weathers

Kathleen Kennedy,JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson take notice. This is how you do Star Wars
brentscott22 November 2019
This is Star Wars. It feels like Star Wars. It Looks Like Star Wars. Why is this such a tough concept for the geniuses associated with the films to get? No subversion's needed, no forced 8 yr old humor, no political agenda. Just make it look and feel like the original Star Wars trilogy and fans will be happy, its literally that simple.

Now THIS is star wars!
snh-8066812 November 2019
This is the closest in FEEL we've ever gotten to the originals. The first episode captured the vision i had as child, lying in bed, reading about bounty hunters and the sleazy underground they operated in. All the while making up my story of how I was too sick to go to school, just so I could stay home and get lost in the universe laid before me. I really feel like I was watching an expanded universe book come to life! I can't think of how they could have pulled this off better! Hats off to Jon Favreau for his true understanding of star wars, and Dave Filoni for setting the tone of the series in such a perfect way. My childhood thanks you!

A New Hope
diornodouwes12 November 2019
A new chapter for Star-Wars, one like we haven't seen before. First of all, you can feel the star wars vibe from a mile away. The beautiful world-building production- and costumedesign, the thrilling cinematography and the great (sound)editing. There are however some aspects that divide this artwork from the trilogies. the type of storytelling for example. focusing completely on one character, and making this one character so interesting.

With a great cast and great producers, I have high hopes for this little show. Thanks in advantage, Mr. Favreau.

Cowboy in a Galaxy Far, Far Away = Pure Magic
Her-Excellency22 November 2019
The Mandalorian (so far) has everything anyone could ask for. It is SO well-crafted, I have yet to see one flaw in it.

Pedro Pascal (is it really him under that mask 100% of the time?) is fantastic as the imperturbable, or so it would seem, outer-space tough guy bounty hunter with a soft, heart-of-gold, and a helmet that into the third episode, still does not budge. We know it's coming though, don't we, and waiting, is a small fraction of the fun. At least it is for me.

While it is somewhat on the side of slow-paced vs. fast-paced, in my opinion that just adds to the appeal. You can savor the onscreen antics, action and dialogue, while knowing more is coming. Actually, you find it kind of exquisite in its pacing. I literally dare you to look away. Not because you think you'll miss anything, but because even at its steady pace, you won't want to. Speaking of which, the visuals are quite impressive. The entire thing IS a Lucas Star Wars landscape. At no time can anyone see a 1-minute clip of The Manadalorian without knowing immediately that it belongs to the Star Wars universe. The twist, is that thrown into this universe now, is this strong proverbial cowboy of few words, who carries a big stick.

I'm a fan, and can hardly wait for more episodes.

This is the way
nerdgasms23 November 2019
I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I have to admit, all hope was beginning to be lost. I was excited for The Mandalorian but had my bar set very low. But my God man this is amazing! I can't believe it's this good! The OG Star Wars vibes are crazy! It's like they took the original Star Wars and buffed it with modern day big budget CGI without making it a crappy blockbuster. The story is actually incredible so far and every episode is better than the last. I was gonna just watch these online but I've gotta support Disney+ for finally allowing something good to come out of them owning Star Wars. Thanks Jon Favreau, this is the way.

My faith in Disney Star Wars has been restored
thorbutwithagut12 November 2019
Easily the best thing Disney Star Wars has produced, and my faith in Disney Star Wars has been restored. Great job on this one Disney!! And on a side note, I think Jon Favreau oughta be running Disney Star Wars instead of Kathleen Kennedy because he actually understands how to capture the essence of Star Wars.

Star Wars - just somewhere completely else!
SigTheMan12 November 2019
Just watched the first episode, and I have got to say, this is Star Wars. The characters, the graphics, the vehicles, the animals... everything is Star Wars. It isn't connected to any other Star Wars movies, and even though it is placed in the universe after the end of Star Wars VI, it still feels totally detached from that story.

But, it still feels like Star Wars, looks like Star Wars, and sounds like Star Wars. I believe this is going to be a blast among Star Wars fans. For those who simply like good movies and TV series, including Star Wars, this will be a good treat, but might not be the highlight of the year!

I rather pay to see this in the cinema than Episode 9
panzerskraft23 November 2019
So far I've seen three chapters and I would actually rather pay to see the rest of the chapters at the cinema than Episode 9 when it's released in a couple of weeks. We already know what garbage Disney cocked up there - based upon episodes 7 and 8. The Mandalorian is fun and exciting with a true Star Wars feeling. No identity politics that I've noticed so far. Just plain good and simple goodness.

Started off great, not sure now
sagamnord6 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Ok, so I have a lot to say about this series. Sorry in advance for any misspellings. I'm a tired swede, sue me.

In the first three episodes, I was really into it. The story seemed promising, Mando was awesome, and it really felt like the mandalorian could be something special. Then I saw episode four, and realized that it's gonna be "one of those series." It gave me a kind of early Supernatural feeling, in the sense that they go from place to place, meeting and saying goodbye to people that never really make an impact or contribute to the story. Since I thought this would be more like a for example Stranger Things type of series, where the plot is very evident, I was a bit disappointed I guess.

The script also seemed more awkward, I got really confused about the decisions the characters made. By the end of it, I wasn't as excited to see what would happen in the next episode as I was before.

When I watch a movie/series I want to know things like where the story is going, what the protagonist's goal is and who the antagonist is, but now I have no clue. Like, what exactly is Mando's plan? How is he going to stop all the trackers from revealing baby yoda's location? And WHY is he leaving baby yoda unprotected all the time if he wants him safe + he's being targeted???

I guess the best way to describe what I'm feeling is by making a video game reference. It feels like the main story arc is being ignored, and we're witnessing the side quests. I get that it's fun to do them, cause it builds character, makes you discover more about the world, and all that jazz. But I can safely say that almost everyone over the age of 6 already knows A LOT about both mandalorians and the star wars universe. The first three episodes were a great introduction as well to those who doesn't, so why not just crack on with the main plot?

I've only gotten to episode five (arguably a better episode than episode four, but still feels a bit stale), and there are four more episodes to come, which gives me hope that maybe it'll get better. Only time will tell I guess. Maybe my rating will have changed when I'm done with this season.

That was my little rant, lol.

The only problem I have is, the length of the episode
crusty_justy12 November 2019
For a monthly subscription streaming show, I felt 39mins for an episode was a bit short! It's like they intended it to be shown on tv with ad breaks. It just felt short and especially for what normally would be a pilot. It just felt like it started and when it ended, it was just the end of a scene, not the end of the whole episode. I can't wait for the next episode but that looks to be in another two weeks away, as listed on here. That seems very random for a series.

Show has ultimate star wars feel but it is running on 5th episod and I don't see any plot point of character development. Feel is good but you can not relate to it. Show is going through pointless episodes.

Disney Finally Makes Star Wars
Vrian Sinth13 November 2019
I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. Saw ESB and ROTJ as a kid in the theater. I haven't been impressed with much of what Disney has done with the exception of Rogue One. The Last Jedi was such a turnoff I almost bailed on Disney Star Wars completely. This first episode finally feels like I'm in the Star Wars universe again.

Started great but ...
nugebb7 December 2019
I usually like to give a show at least a season to prove itself but there was a dramatic quality difference between the first three episodes and the following two. I started watching because the initial reviews were amazing so I thought a bit of a follow up might be helpful to those considering whether to start watching now.

The first three shows were actually amazing. Fantastic world building, intriguing characters, gorgeous sets and excellent CGI. More importantly, it felt as though the writers assumed the audience was intelligent and willing to wait for a good story to unfold throughout the season.

Then in episodes 4 and 5, everything seemed to come off the rails. The plots of both episodes were boring and pretty tired. I won't spoil but they felt like something from the eighties. There was also an over reliance on 'cute' which Disney is often guilty of but I found overdone even for them. This may have been to disguise the lack of good story telling. Perhaps the most disappointing element was when, in episode 4, the writers seemed to decide that the audience was too stupid to figure out a key factor of our main character and used the most stilted dialogue possible to explain it to us.

If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love the world and the fan service happening in this but, unless things change, don't go into it thinking you'll get anything thought-provoking or innovative.

Entertainment & Story worthy of the Star Wars name
nyzealot16 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Episode one was almost too good to be true, hence why I held my thoughts until this second episode but now here we are and I have to express just how brilliant of a star the episodes have been. This new episode was another terrific episode. It was absolutely mind-boggling and inspiring how much they fit into a measly 27 minutes but somehow it didn't feel too short. It felt just right. Just enough action, just enough endearing tiny-little green like-Yoda baby, just enough suspense. And honestly the new score has rubbed off on me so quickly, I think it's gorgeous as it's sweeps over everything like a gentle wave or bad-to-the-bone ensemble (depending on the scene) in this episode. This is opposed to the first episode where I felt they mainly nailed the score but needed to reconfigure where they placed certain renditions.

Episode 2 is beautifully shot and doing a splendid job of having a lot of personality despite giving us basically no information about any of the characters on screen. It's almost telling the story in a Dark Souls-esque style by not telling us much about the characters except through their actions and short but concise dialogue. They are allowing our imaginations to take over. "The Mandalorian", "The Client", "The Asset" - I mean come on those names are just awesome not because they sound cool but because the mystery of the names prime us, demand of us that we ask for me. They are leaning heavily on the "Lone Wolf and Cub" vibes and it's not only working, it's immersive, thrilling and endearing. They're REALLY going in with a "show, don't tell" approach and I can appreciate that. Waiting a week for each new episode will be rough but I'm thrilled to have some new Star Wars content that I'm genuinely excited about after feeling burned by pretty much all of the new movies except Rogue One.

And honorable mentions have to go to the director of episode 2 as well, Rick Famuyiwa, did a fantastic job following up the season premiere and I made sure to take note of his name. To have pulled off what he pulled off in 27 minutes was stunning. This show really captures that old Star Wars magic, from the pacing to the humor to the look and feel of the old films. I have and will continue to watch the first and second episodes multiple times and I suspect I will watch this entire show multiple times just because of how tightly written it is. Here's to our prayers, wishes and good-vibe thoughts to the producers, directors, writers, actors and everyone involved that they continue to give us this level of entertainment and story worthy of the Star Wars name.

Baby Yoda is so cute! And this show is highly overrated
michaeltong-291808 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Star Wars gets a lot of hate these days and with the release of The Mandalorian fans are desperate to have something to love. I don't want to hate it, but I'm baffled by the reviews. At best, The Mandalorian is mediocre.

In our desire to forgive Disney for its mistakes, it's appears we've over-compensated by giving such high praise (and there is something suspicious about the multiple 10/10 user scores from users who've ONLY reviewed this show - and have never reviewed or scored any other Star Wars films).

The Mandalorian is the weakest written show of the subscription-service era that I've seen. It bizarrely follows the outdated model of monster/character/problem of the week. So far, they've only released five episodes, but there is little to no plot and all the characters except Mando, and his infant companion, have been superfluous. They can't even fill out the time of a standard 45-50 minute episode. Most episodes are 30-35 minutes.

When compared to its contemporaries/competitors like Stranger Things, Altered Carbon, and Lost in Space, The Mandalorian isn't even in the same league. That isn't to say it's completely inept. The title character is somewhat interesting, but everything else is hollow. All they have is a mystery-box Mcguffin in Baby Yoda, but don't expect answers any time soon because the writers don't even know, which is why every episode is basically filler.

What The Mandalorian reveals is that Disney only understands Star Wars as an aesthetic, and is still leaning heavily on nostalgia. They should have just called it: 'Star Wars Easter Eggs & References the TV Show,' because that's all it is.

Do you remember IG-88? Do you remember Thermal Detonators? Stormtroopers? Jetpacks? What about Sand-people? Or Jawas? Well good, because The Mandalorian shoehorns them all in so that the Youtubers can give them free advertising by making more 'Top 10 Things You Might Not Have Noticed In Episode 5' videos.

Strangely enough, they are inconsistent with their references and aesthetics. In Episode 5, The Mandalorian goes to Mos Eisley and travels through the desert, but he doesn't even pass by the Sarlac Pit, or the wreckage of Jaba's Barge, nor does anyone confuse him for, or mention, Boba Fett. The color of Tatooine's sand wasn't even right and thus it didn't actually look like Tatooine.

The overall production quality is inconsistent. At times it looks cinematic, and other times it looks like a Star Trek TV show - or something for the Sci-Fi channel 5 or 10 years ago. They could afford a CGI establishing shot for some village on a planet no one will remember, but when they went to Tatooine they didn't even have an establishing shot of one of Star War's most iconic locations.

The green screen matting is often Prequel-level obvious, and so far the locations have been uninteresting. They even managed to make the Mos Eisly Cantina seem like a boring place.

The Soundtrack is god-awful and it's the most distracting thing in the show. The Mandalorian title theme is a catchy rip-off of the Westworld title theme, but the rest of the score sounds like it was pre-made. It rarely fits what's on screen, often swelling to dramatic peaks in odd places. There was a scene where The Mandalorian's ship blasted off and the score made it sound like The Avengers were assembling. Yet for some reason, every time they enter a Cantina it goes dead-quiet. For all the references they put in the show, they couldn't compose fun Cantina vibes?

Overall, although the concept had potential, it's failing to execute and it's lightyears behind its peers. It isn't bad. At least it doesn't conflict with cannon, or degrade beloved characters, but it's a meager offering that hardly justifies a subscription to Disney+.

So good, and without useless childlike humour!!
fireflicker3825 January 2020
I enjoyed the first season immensely, it was far better than I could have ever imagined. This is the real Star Wars. Lately I have tired from silly comedy/humour that is in other action/sci fi films of late. Not The Mandalorian, thank goodness it feels more like adult entertainment. Can't wait for season 2!!

This is Star Wars
alvarhaggis1 January 2020
All those feelings of watching the original trilogy have come back. The Prequel Trilogy was a mockery of the franchise. The Sequel Trilogy failed to either capture the old, or create a solid new, and got caught in between leaving them a little empty.

Rogue One sailed very close to Empire as the best Star Wars movie going. All by doing what the other two trilogies couldn't do, by recapturing the feeling of the being in the Original Universe. Those movies felt completely separate universes and places from the one we'd known.

The Mandalorian has that feeling in spades. It feels so connected to Star Wars in a way most of the other movies couldn't. The place looks and feels real. Feels like the lawless chaos of a galaxy at war the originals always carried.

The characters don't invite you to like them, they just go about this tough galaxy, surviving any way they can.

The characters are deeply interesting, and are full of myth and lore of their own, away from Jedi. This mythology is also not explained neatly, or offered to you in a grand piece of exposition. It's hinted at, sometimes only in the visuals. Yet the mythology feels connected to everything that feels Star Wars.

Kudos to the creators. It's a wonderful show if you're an original Star Wars fan. The season finale was just brilliant, and the first few minutes has the single best Storm Trooper interaction ever filmed. I've never laughed so hard at Star Wars, and it wasn't a forced or contrived joke.

I've watched the entire first season and I can easily give it 10/10

Amazing
noahadams-4399630 December 2019
I love this show so much. I don't understand people who say this show it only geared towards hardcore Star Wars fans. This was the first Star Wars thing my aunt ever saw and she loved it as well. Madno had a great character arc and felt like he learned a lot from where he started in the first episode. Episode 3 and 8 are my favorites and I'd say the only one that is pretty bad is episode 5 but even that episode has good elements. So hyped for season 2!!!

If You Enjoyed Rogue One You Will Love This
JTReviewsPlus12 November 2019
The last few Star Wars products have been disappointing to put it lightly. Star Wars Resistance, Last Jedi, Solo, and BF2 have put a bad taste in many fans mouths. However, The Mandalorian is an epic new series with a tone of the original trilogy with grittiness/modernization of Rogue One. Jon Favreau, Dave Filoni, and the rest of crew seem to have a much better understanding of the universe and lore than Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams. The pilot is only 37 minutes long (not including credits) which is a little disappointing but every second is utilized extremely well. The Mandalorian is creating a visually stunning universe filled with planets fans have yet been explored and interesting characters that viewers still have to learn more about. If there is one thing every fan can agree on is that Pedro Pascal is perfect as The Mandalorian.

Lone Wolf and Cub
breade00722 November 2019
Being a fan of the japanese cinema of the 50s through the 70s...I instantly related The Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub....I love how the Star Wars universe parallels the journeys of Ronin and Samurai alike!

"Baby-Yoda" is the only reason i'm still watching
jani-konttila5 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This series is poorly written. It's just a series of quests that don't arouse any interest in the viewer. There's no depth to the story. No real story to speak of. None of the characters have any charisma. The lack of charisma is a problem with all the recent Star Wars movies too.

The only reason i'm still watching after a couple of episodes is "baby-Yoda". It's the only character who's interesting, and he's completely carrying the series.

Boring
hannahsmith-7882327 January 2020
Badly written, and no character motivation. It is genuinely quite hard to watch. Most characters have the personality of one or two tropes with no nuance and the plot is shallow and I would say predictable but the plot is so bad it is hard to predict the next wrong turn it takes.

I have to admit ,i was adamant this be really what it cracked up to be ...and i was taken aback .....im already watching for third time the pilot . ..if all the episodes bring up the standard to the first one , all ill say is bloody hell ...if you been a long time Star Wars fan ,you will expect high standards ...well this reviewer comes from the uk and did expect a very high standard ...what was delivered by Jon was first many Easter eggs and second a very well researched arc of the Mandalorian tribe itself ...amazed ....bring on the rest of the episodes.

And yes Jon should take over lucasfilm but with Dave Filoni ..both know Star Wars and can deliver better than Kathleen Kennedy....

A solid start
nguyenbakhanhbicondova12 November 2019
Let's just get the obvious thing out of the way, the production value is top-notch, everything is practical and breathtaking. The cinematography is simply beautiful. Those things coupled with marvelous sound design resulted in a very immersive looking world, which is a must for any Star-Wars film/show.

The first episode doesn't spend any time building the characters and just get right down to the business, which is both good and bad. Good because you don't have to wait very long for some sweet action, which is quite well done here. Bad because our main character, The Mandalorian, is pretty boring, at least so far. His dialogue, his voice, his action, nothing is unique, nothing makes him standout. The only thing you get to know about this guy is shown through a vague flashback, the oldest trick in the book. He was built up as the best bounty hunter, but then is easily taken down by 2 fish-like creatures. I'm all for characters not being super overpowered ( looking at you, Rey ) but maybe give him some real threats if you want to show that your character is not God ( and maybe wait a bit longer before doing it too) ? The fact that we don't see his face also doesn't help. Dredd 2012 works because Karl Urban's lips are extremely expressive, but emotion is just not an option here.

This episode also has a lot of conveniences, and couple of things don't make sense, which is a let down for me because I expected Game of Thrones (season 1-4) level of realism. But this is Star-Wars, suspension of disbelief has always been a part of the franchise, so it's not a big deal. One piece of dialogue near the end in particular is just bad, The Mandalorian literally asks the same question twice. The dialogue in this show doesn't show any promise beyond being serviceable too.

Could have been a lot better, but not bad. Can be really entertaining if you're a Star-Wars fan. I really love the western, cowboy feeling.

7/10 for episode 1

Dull mini stories that hardly connect with eachother
danielvanloosbroek3 December 2019
After episode 4, I will stop watching this series. I still haven't seen any character development or build up. I haven't seen his face or any emotion. Every episode seems like a stand alone simple childish story. The marketing is great though, as well as the editing.

Don't understand the hype
spooknezz28 January 2020
I don't understand where all the hype for this show comes from. I find the show slow and boring. The acting isn't very good either and the use of dolls and bad cgi is just meh.

5/10 - Don't get your hopes up. It's a snore fest.

So Bland
thekingsdom1 December 2019
To be honest, 'Youwillhateme's' review hit the nail on the head. This is badly written and the story is all over the shop. On episode 4, I started laughing when he got into a punch up with the woman. He's a hard core trained fighter wearing a metal helmet, yet this woman is able to punche him in the head (bare fisted into his metal helmet) and kicks his arse. Ha! Hilarious. That's when I pressed stop. Meh! There seems to be a serious lack of good writers about nowadays. This show could have gone anywhere yet what they've created is very poor. My advice to all the networks is..invest in writers first. No matter how good the effects, no matter how big the budget, if the writing is pants, the show will be pants. BTW, they're making everyone in the UK wait until March before this is released. Good luck with that.

I'm surprised people like this.
daisukereds4 December 2019
In summary, it is visually impressive! Yet manages to be very bland and boring. Like Saturday cartoon level of content, with less colors, dialogue or dumb jokes. Even the way the Mandalorian walks is dull..

I specially dislike the inspiring music over terrible moments (like walking).. and the terrible CGI. There is nothing inspiring or memorable about the 4 episodes that have been released so far. Not even the choreographies are good.

But it is terrible clever! The show is SO bad that people are going crazy over the one thing that is designed to be cute and appealing. And people are eating it up. It's incredible.

bereitsvergeben-2208612 November 2019
Because right now it's just trying hard to look like star wars and that's it. The editing is really bad. Nothing really happens. Scene, talk 2 sentences, dramatic music, next scene... Repeat. No idea who the characters are. Why they do what they do. Everything just smooth and bland

How can anyone give this a 10?
RomanXO7 February 2020
Warning: Spoilers
With 2 to 4 more or less bad filler episodes (depending on who you ask); there is no logical reason to still give out a 10, even if you love the show and setting.

But of course it makes sense because the story is paper thin. It would be told in 3 or 4 episodes; hence the need to stretch it out with filler episodes.

Sadly, we don't see the Mandalorian's face except in one scene; so character development and empathy is a tough call. Why don't we see him eat, sleep, wash his face without the helmet? Instead the only thing we get are flashbacks to explain how he is potentially suffering below his helmet.

We know he hates droids. But after being bandaged one time by a droid he gets all emotional about him. Isn't this a bit too much of a change of mind?

The other characters stay mostly bland. There is nothing quirky or witty about any of them. They are there to serve the plot without any own motivation. They are so simply written it's almost insulting. 'Hey big girl you don't like Stormtroopers? Then join me to beat up some Stormtroopers.'

The production value is good; but the story/reliance on fillers and poor writing drags it all down to simply average.

So far, so slow.
newtonpost6 February 2020
I have just finished watching episode 8 (the last one) and have to say that my hope that something revelatory was going to happen has been dashed.

What is essentially a cowboy film in space is slow, dull and lacking any memorable characters. I understand that a second season will be made and hope that somebody decides to employ better scriptwriters and stop feeding us this mogadon.

Star Wars is actually alive!!
kiriakos_kriven2 January 2020
Nothing much to say, the franchise was dead to me after the last two movies (The last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker), Disney make sure of that.... But than it came The Mandalorian and resurrected the Star Wars universe from the ashes! Jon Favreau I love you and I thank you!! Over there at Disney HQ, give the guy the keys to the Star Wars universe and get the hell out of the way!! Jon Favreau is clearly a fan of Star Wars and saw all the mistakes and heard the fans disappointment!! Thank you sir once again for the hopes you gave us and we will be expecting the second season with a smile on our face!!

Amazing tv show
esme-5566025 January 2020
I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for the next season! Each episode is exciting in its own way and baby yoda is the best. The acting is really good and there's good action. If u like any of the star wars movies, tv shows or books u will like this show. And its very family friendly

Great but short.
blazkusnik17 November 2019
Went in to this not having any real expectations (from the way Star Wars has been doing in the past years), but I have to say I was hooked from the first minute to the last. Unfortunately the episodes are very much on the short side, but on the other hand I never got the feeling that it was rushed in any part, which considering the length of the episodes and all that is going on is a feat on itself.

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the show. If the movies had the feel of this show, they would be a huge hit with the Star Wars fans (at least the ones that are out of puberty), unfortunately this show is all we have for the time being. I want more and I want it as soon as possible.

Seriously, don't bother if you're over 12. This looks like a kids show designed purely to sell merchandise, theme park rides, etc. No logic, holes all over the shop, no characters motivation and really crap acting to top it off... just rubbish, really

A great start
SkepticalSy12 November 2019
From the set's, to the actors, the dialogue, to the costumes this is a great TV series. What's even better is that it's a Star Wars TV series. To me, the Mandalorian has a definite Star Wars feel to it, in the classic sense. I have not seen the cartoon Star Wars TV shows and probably never will, so this is my first introduction to Star Wars for TV, and so far it hasn't disappointed.

YES! Great job Disney.
evansego12 November 2019
If you like westerns, star wars, and sci fi this is the show for you. Without giving much away think of it as a Boba Fett like character/species having his own television show...can't go wrong with that right? After watching the first episode, I cant wait to see what Disney has to offer for the reminder of the season. I see a lot of potential in this series. With non stop action this is a must watch for Star Wars Fans. The episodes are approximately 40 minutes in length and will be streaming on Disney Plus. The first season will contain 8 episodes airing once a week.

No story SW
Yizahi5 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This thing completely lacks story it seems that was done intentionally. First - to sell this to China, second - to sell merchandise on Christmas. Completely dumb series, dumber even than last jedi. 4 stars for amazing graphics -1 star for microyoda obvious fanservice -1 star for so called "mandalorians", who are changing their characters every few minutes. Mighty "warriors", yeah, right... -1 star for second episode which is mindnumbingly dumb and cringy and unmotivated -1 star for fourth episode, which is basically an oldest and most overused story in all movie history and done badly -1 star for all dumb "plot" moves like carbonite traps (authors probably never watched episodes 4-6), evil lair and good lair being is nearby buildings, mircoyoda as powerful as a thousand year old strongest jedi master in history, making a spaceship with a wrench and so on. -1 star for service lock

Klayman-blair773 December 2019
Quite disappointed that I purchased the Disney subscription based on this show. The show feels good, and they took their time with the production design. But the writing is so weak. Limp lines and there is a pace of the show tends to drag in spots. Baby Yoda makes for good comic relief...but not sure that was their point. Needs to be grittier.

Welcome back Star Wars
kmonk100125 November 2019
It feels like the original Star Wars movies. And the storyline is 100% better than any one of the last 6 movies. The show takes you on a journey and I'm enjoying the ride with laughs, shock and all I of the other emotions. I feel this show has redeemed Star Wars after episodes I, II and III. My faith in the force has been awakened.

Jon Favreau does it again
elroy_geronimo29 November 2019
Jon Favreau is a freaking master of the Star Wars Universe... The love for the source material, the compelling thought out story, the attention to detail and the immaculate execution just ooze out of every episode and make this my favourite TV-show ever and easily slides in my top 3 of my 40 years of Star Wars experiences. Come on, a charismatic hero even though we never see his face, each episode that feels like a mini movie and has you longing for more and on top of all that: a freaking hilarious and super adorable baby Yoda! What's not to love? Must see TV for everyone and for Star Wars fans who were disappointed by any of the sequels and spin offs this is you chance for a New Hope!

May the force be with you

The Reason We Watched Star Wars In The First Place
ohiostforever27 November 2019
Finally someone has captured the true essence of Star Wars with The Mandalorian. This I truly feel is the reason that it became the phenomena that it was in the 80s. The casting, the ambience, the acting, and most importantly the writing. Nothing seems forced. It just has flowed so seamlessly. I know its been only 3 episodes but its been awhile since there has been any show that I cannot wait for the next one since this. Every single Disney Star Wars movie that has been released I have came walking out of the theater feeling...Ehhh. So very forgettable. Especially The Last Jedi that was by far the most disappointing imo. To wrap this up The Mandalorian has blown away my expectations a true 10 out 10 so far.

The most cringeworthy thing I've seen in a long time
Youwillhateme30 November 2019
As an early Star Wars fan, this franchise is becoming more and more embarrassing by the release.

This latest Mandalorian is another example of just terrible writing from people that very likely never watched Star Wars before. Everything about the Mandalorian is an assault to Boba Fett, from the lack of coolness, cheesy dialogue, Clint Eastwood imitation, to the wimpy personality and back story that makes no sense.

The silly looking Gizmo they try to pass off as Yoda is only accepted by fan boys and/or the least sophisticated movie goers.

The last Episode (4) topped the cringe fest with characters from Lord Of the Rings to the new woman side kick that apparently will teach a whole "primitive" tribe to fight the Empire with sticks. That was done in Return of the Jedi, we didn't need that again. What the original trailer did was to deceive people into this was actually something amazing. It isn't and what a shame it is.

There is zero focus on anything. It's like they just threw in a bunch of random likeable characters from the original loved trilogy to appease fans, but it's done without any rhyme or reason. The story is all over the place going from one thing to another without connection whatsoever. It reminds me of the very promising LOST series, which ended up being a bunch of just random gibberish. I could literally write a two hour review pointing out minute by minute what's wrong with it, and that would include the horrible acting.

Just seeing a landspeeder and a few characters from the Cantina scene isn't enough to quench my thirst.

As some others have pointed out, the only real reason why there are "rave reviews" is due to the dismal quality of films and shows being released so anything remotely decent gets accolades by the public. However, this is a total let down.

The best Disney Star Wars product so far, but still terrible.
RJR99SS1 December 2019
I'm actually somewhat awed that so many people seem to like this show. I have to admit it's the best modern Star Wars product since disney took over, but it's still an awful show.

The writing is horrendous. It suffers from the same flaws the movies have, which is that the writers don't even understand the basic concept of story telling, therefore it's astounding to see them tackle as something as difficult as a tv show or a movie. Watching this show, or the movies, is basically like trying to watch a a not-so-bright 3rd grader try to recount how the original movies went.

There's massive plot holes in just about anything that happens in this show, and you're constantly asking why on earth (or the galaxy, whatever) our hero is even doing what he's doing...and even he doesn't seem to know aside from it's what the script is calling for.

The main character in this is a guy in armor, A mandalorian, a word I used to pride myself on knowing back in the early 90s, but now couldn't care less. He's a good guy...you know, when the script needs him to be. He's a bad guy occasionally....but not really, he always does the right thing eventually. He likes uh....you know...stuff, and dislikes uh....being shot at? Except...i dunno, actually i think he says he likes getting shot at some point in the show. He never takes his helmet off, because. That's about it for him.

The entire "story" of the series is basically just a bunch of poorly thought out ideas that are brought into play in order to setup the next battle scene and then quickly discarded. The real heart of the show is the fight scenes, but none of them are done particularly well, they're actually pretty formulaic. Our hero goes into unbeatable odds with guns blazing, insert a couple of comic moments, and then the whole scene is magically resolved (sometimes literally) with our hero coming out on top because of some incredibly implausible turn of events.

It's fairly obvious that the Mandalorian is invincible, he falls 80 feet out of the air and lands on a bolder, he's shot numerous times, he's exploded, he's gored by a 40 ton rhino thing, never suffering any serious injury. It's kind of hard to take the series seriously when you know how every battle is going to end before they happen, and our hero can basically do no wrong.

The only things this series has going for it is that it's not QUITE as badly done as the movies, and yes the baby Yoda is very cute.

Authentic Star Wars - At Long Last.
LouieInLove18 November 2019
The latest trilogy of Star Wars films are propagandised drivel, devoid of the human experience; devoid of soul - made for social media morons.

The Mandalorian (so far) is authentic Star Wars: Sexy, fun, edgy, intriguing & leaves you wanting more.

I so hope it doesn't get neo-Disney'd in later episodes.

This may have just saved Star Wars
welkerjustin-7234712 November 2019
I have not been a fan of the new Star Wars films with exception to Rogue One. All the other new films (especially The Last Jedi) have been awful and have ruined the story of Star Wars. However, Disney may have just redeemed themselves with this series. The first episode is more than I could have hoped for. The visuals, the dialogue, and the characters are brilliant. I'm also impressed with the tone that Disney have taken with this series. The comedy is also very genuine and reminds me of the originals as far as the jokes go. There's no stupid your mom jokes (thank you Last Jedi for ruining Star Wars). Overall, I am blown away by The Mandalorian and I only hope that it stays this way (or gets better).

Best Star Wars since 83'
jfritchey22 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
So far this show has proved to be probably the best thing that could've happened to television today. After becoming a bit tired of game of thrones' underwhelming extensively long episodes. This is an amazing change of pace similar to the old serials on TV. It's quality film only giving you exactly what you need and not being over-zealous. Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau know star wars better than those making the movies. The "Mando" has to be one of the coolest heroes to come out of star wars since Han Solo. A man of few words and quick action. The way that this character is written, his subtle actions and querks make him a great lead for this lone Wolf and Cub story line. Very interested to see the remaining 5 episodes.

Fandom is overrating this so far
gregoryblanch8813 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The first episode of The Mandalorian wasn't bad, but in my opinion does not deserve the stratospheric rating it has achieved. At least so far.

In the first episode we are treated to an overabundance of scenes with the eponymous character walking through sets that scream "decaying civilization in the aftermath of an empire's fall" rather too obviously. Fine but enough already we get it. The other dominating theme is the Mandalorian on other violence which will get old pretty quickly.

I worry a little that the helmet, which is a character on its own, is taking away from the character's ability to display emotions. After all most great performances in TV or cinema have been written on actors faces, and even those stoic anti/heroes had microexpressions that gave them substance. We will never get that chance with a helmet that never comes off. Or will we?

I'm willing to give this series time to find a more engaging vibe. Stars Wars devotees obviously love it, and I'm happy for them. For the rest of us this is a fair start but more will have to be done to make this one of the greats.

Edit: The second episode moves the quality needle a notch, and we get a more relatable Mandalorian in the process. What the Jawas do with the egg is something of an anticlimax though,

It started bad, but actually gets worse and worse by the week
MovieCriticOnline7 December 2019
This was just a disappointing mess from the beginning, from the bad actor playing the bounty hunter to horrible supporting actors. This is like a bad TBS TV movie like Xena or Saturday morning cartoon for kids that don't know any better.

You still have to accept that a Boba Fett character now has heart and compassion and cares for a little green creature, AKA the horrid Gizmo looking Yoda.. and the Mandalorian voice, oh, the voice... just laughable.

The music doesn't fit.

Really just sad that this much talent regarding set designs, props special effects is being wasted on this insanely horrible writing, acting and directing. The story is all over the place and lacks focus.

The last episodes with the Orc looking creatures and to the recent episode with the annoying robots and the other totally miscast b-movie actors. Just some of THE most annoying characters ever... a total disgrace to Star Wars and Lucas.

They don't know if they want this to be serious or a joke, so instead it became a mess.

People are just starving for anything remotely decent they will praise any garbage on TV now.

It is so painfully cringe worthy to watch. SAD!

So bad, I have to see if it gets any better
stilian_m_todorov25 November 2019
The Mandalorian is so bad that I have to continue watching because I can not believe what I am witnessing. The story is so bad it makes the prequels look like a masterpiece. I genuinely feel bad for Star Wars fans, having to pretend what they are watching is any good. Either that or they really are the stupidest fans in the world. All of these 11/10 reviews make me sad. I will say that visually its great. The directing is so dumb, the acting is so dumb, the story is so dumb, the actual script is so dumb, there are giant, and I meant GIANT holes in the whole mechanics of the show, feels rushed, feels like a cash grab. I will say that Star Wars is in no way science fiction any more, leave that to Star Trek please, Star Wars is now Fantasy, and not very good fantasy at best. At least in that iteration. I came out of the Force Awakens feeling like I watched something really visually striking, yet I knew I watched a repeat of A new hope and TESB combined. I watched the Last Jedi and knew I saw more of the same, but it was more of a crap. I now watch Mandi, the most skilled of the Mandi's in the parsec, get almost certainly killed a few times per episode, like if he was completely inept. I will continue to watch it, simply because Its so bad.SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD, and it could have been so much better. More Rogue One, less Mandi, please, you corporate entity.

Shallow. Predictable. No plot. Full of cliches. Boring. Stretches a story that can be told in 10 minutes, into a whole episode, full of nothing. I like the original Star Wars episodes - 4, 5, 6. The newer the episodes, the worse they get. My advice? Don't waste your time, not worth it.

I thought the creators would capitalise on television's ability to flesh out a story & its characters - providing the main cast with quieter, reflective moments you rarely get the opportunity to explore in blockbuster movies - but instead it's just undeveloped, by-the-numbers & overly "safe", veering in the opposite direction - throwing in another collection of explosions & CGI fight sequences - whenever it gets too close to making any bold or interesting (potentially moral or political) statements.

Yes, there are numerous well constructed set pieces & the series itself looks beautiful (with photorealistic visuals effects & sublime cinematography) but all of this is utterly meaningless with such a hollow, characterless void. They could've added more scenes to expand upon the protagonist & antagonist's interactions & motivations but alas, they don't.

Even after 3 episodes, it's clear this is a corporate product - simplistic, easily digestible content that offers enough to satisfy watchers of each episode by providing the bare minimum for viewers who are impressed by that sort of thing but if you're looking for actual SUBSTANCE rather than style, look elsewhere because this offers NOTHING.

Elementary plot, characters, story, and dialogue.
WillNotLie22 December 2019
I've never created an account to review a movie in my life, but this will be my first. I sincerely don't understand how people are in denial that they believe this show is good. I would love to smoke whatever they are smoking. I can imagine that their insincere reviews are highly reflectant of their heart strings being pulled with the use of "baby yoda."

I just want to emphasize how bad this show is that the supporting characters are all irrelevant and there is no real story. The dialogue in this show was most likely written by a 5 year old and the action scenes were choreographed by a blind man. There is no real character development and the entire problem solving formula revolves around cheese and cringe.

Here's why The Mandalorian works and the sequels don't
petra_ste17 November 2019
The Mandalorian is not perfect, but it's fun. Just like Rogue One, it does feel like Star Wars, far more than episodes 7 and 8.

Why?

1) It tells a Star Wars tale WITHOUT messing up the original characters/trilogy. Some fans were cheering when Han and Luke and company were returning for the sequels, but I was dreading it. Their story was over. Their character arcs were done (Luke: naive farmer->wise, powerful Jedi; Han: selfish rogue->selfless hero). By bringing them back you can only butcher them (Luke), reboot them to square one (Han) or freeze them as if they've spent the last three decades doing the same stuff (Leia).

The Mandalorian follows the story of a bounty hunter (who is NOT Boba Fett, avoiding another pitfall). We see familiar factions and races, fun side characters (IG-11, Ugnaught Nick Nolte...), the sense of fun and adventure is there, TELLING A FRESH STORY IN THE STAR WARS SETTING. Was that so hard?

2) The protagonist is flawed. He's got that Indiana Jones quality where he is cool and competent but still struggles and fails and messes up, which humanizes him and increases tension when he is in danger.

30min episodes?
benntune3 January 2020
What is this...a sitcom? 30min episodes are a joke. No wonder you get to the end of the series and there's no storyline whatsoever. No character development... just a merchandising exercise to sell baby yodas. I haven't been this disappointed in a series for a long time. Got to the end and was no closer to knowing anything then when i started. Massive missed opportunity.

The Good, the Bad and the Average
floppylobster-86-28332813 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Not bad by any means, but nothing really original, maybe a touch too much fan service but nothing that will stop me watching.

I guess it played it very safe. Leaning on Western tropes very, very heavily. I doubt their young Disney audience have seen many westerns so they'll get away with riffing off older, better films for now. Jon Favreau likes westerns and sci-fi so he makes sense as the writer. Filoni has done some good Star Wars work in the past, so makes sense as the director. He's not directed live action before and that shows in a couple of places.

5 Stars from me is not saying it's bad. Just very average. It could easily go up in my opinion and probably will. But for now I'm intrigued but not excited. It's not a show I'd be urging anyone who wasn't a Star Wars fan to watch.

The Good :

There's nothing so bad it breaks the universe or the characters. Basically not enough happens either way to be able to criticise.

The special effects are good.

Werner Herzog was an inspired piece of casting.

The alien races mostly looked organic and from the Star Wars universe.

The Bad :

The fan service goes a little far in a couple of places - As I recall carbon freezing was just something they did at Bespin. It wasn't meant for humans but they tested it on Han to make sure Luke wouldn't be killed. Yet somehow this has now spread through the galaxy and is a common method for the capture of wanted criminals. Why? It's a piece of fan service. And there are many. Maybe too many (get ready for your close-up Gonk droid).

Blurrgs, the 'horses' used are from Endor. How they end up on this desert planet is a bit of stretch but okay. I still don't get why it's essential to learn how to ride one to reach where the bounty is. It really didn't seem that far or that difficult to reach it. The idea of him learning to ride a 'horse' (another Western trope) probably looked better in the script.

And the Average:

The lead is pretty bland so far. We know his helmet comes off, and everyone's already started referencing it. Just do it already and make him more human. Too-cool-for-school characters like Boba Fett or Sub-Zero only work as side characters, not leads.

As a side note, no one seemed very comfortable walking around with the Mandalorian helmets on. Both characters who wore them seemed to be looking down constantly, watching their steps so they didn't fall over. It made them move stiffly on the stairs and they probably should have practiced a little more to make it look more natural.

Taika seemed wasted. It's his natural inflections that help his comedic timing come through. His NZ accent came through on a couple of lines but you can't hear them under the voice synthesizer they're using.

OVERALL I'm sure everything will start coming together. Characters we've seen will return and become more fleshed out. Storylines will develop. There was a lot riding on this so I can understand they didn't want to take risks. It's a solid 'B' for long-time fans and probably an 'A' for younger (especially male) fans. So that's enough to not annoy anyone and will maximize their audience.

Disappointed, so close but so far
philhemstock-117828 December 2019
It looks like Star Wars. It sounds like Star Wars. But that's where it ends.

The effects team have done a great job of getting the look right, it really does fit in with the films in terms of that. But when it come to the storyline and acting, it's woefully poor.

The big bad Mandalorian, this great bounty hunter, is actually a bit of a wimp. He only seems to win any fights because of his superior armour. Without that he would lose against everyone he's been up against so far.

There's no character to him. Even the great Fett had more than this guy. Very bland, very wooden.

Also the stories remind me of the A-Team. Each episode another person is in distress or needs help. The Mandalorian saves the day and then it's over, move on. But because the episodes are only 30 minutes, you don't even get a good feel for the people involved!!

I really felt this could have been good, the opening episode showed real promise, but then it just plummets into Disney land with a cure baby Yoda thing and not much more.

If nothing improves soon I'll stop watching.

Egregiously over rated
jasongrady-457888 December 2019
The story only offers a baseline introduction to the characters and development quickly became stagnant. Whos decision was it to make an infant and a masked mute the main characters, probably the best option they could have gone with because if it were anything else we'd see how garbage the dialogue was. Seems like a bunch of amateur directors were given power to write a TV show. Boring. Thanks for not making me watch an hour of this.

Good, but too fast-paced
eugenia_loli12 November 2019
The production values on this series is off the roof (they even used anamorphic lenses and an Alexa LF, the highest one can get today budget-wise). Very classical Star Wars-looking and feeling, I think the older fans will be happy with this series.

My only complain is that the editing was way too fast. The actual live action only was 37 minutes! Usually, pilots on non-network TVs are anywhere between 55 and 70 minutes, to create the new world, capture it, and hook us in. The Mandalorian instead was hop-hop-hop, from one place to another, without much time to enjoy the various planets/places. The establishing shots simply weren't there, and that hurt the atmosphere of the show.

Overall though, not bad, it's a cowboy fantasy sci-fi.

Typical YA stuff from anything Lucas
apowell80229 November 2019
It's okay. Some characters are amusing and unique to see...but the Mandalorian himself is as bland as someone always wearing a helmet would be, and he is predictably safe in all the (poorly choreographed) fight scenes. Do not go into this imagining it's as good as a 9.1 rating. Even if you like it a lot it isn't close to that. Reviews are getting more and more absurd and presumably easy to purchase. After 3 episodes i'll give it a 6 rating, and that's a stretch, but i suppose i will finish season one to see what happens to the kid.

Disney Why Don't You Get Smart and give Jon Favreau His Own Star Wars Trilogy?!?!
jon-stokes21-539-1787524 November 2019
I was so close to rating this a 10, the show is close to perfection. The feel, the story, the execution feels like classic Star Wars and blows away the new 2 episodes Disney has released under the new trilogy.

Its time for Disney to give Jon Favreau his own Trilogy.

wujekwladek24 November 2019
This is definitely something I didnt expect. As a biug SW fan for years, I watched last of it just to know what is goin on, before the last upcoming title. But this blows my mind. Its new but seems like I watch classic SW movie. The characters are just right, the enviroenment seems legit and Mando is as should be. Another words, my hope is restored in Star Wars !!!

Star Wars made for children
razzle-43 December 2019
I saw the trailer and thought:"Wow!" Then I saw the ratings and couldn't wait to begin seeing it. Then I finally saw the first four episodes, but was left with disappointment. At first I couldn't figure out why. The idea is good making a story about a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe, but episode after episode it is like something is missing. At first I thought it was due to low budget, but it has a super high budget, so it wasn't that. But then it dawned on me that the whole series is made for children, and then it all made sense. The effects are great, but the story is super simplistic, the dialogue is full of cliches and comic reliefs (some quite funny mind you), the music is overly joyful and everything is made very simple and straightforward ... as you would tell a story to a child. So if you have a kid, you want to introduce to the Star Wars universe, this is a great option, but if you were hoping for a Clint Eastwood like spaghetti Western set in the Star Wars universe, you can safely pass this one by.

How overhyped...
rennmauslisa2 February 2020
First things first, the visuals are cool, very cool. And this is the only reason I gave four stars here. For the rest: Are you kidding me? I really don't get how one can honestly give this show more than 5 stars. There isn't even a story! And I watched the whole eight episodes. Every episode I waited for some Kind of character development or the slightest hint of a plot. But no, there's nothing.

I am honestly a bit shocked by how good the reviews here are. This show gives nothing new, besides a whole lot of Baby Yoda memes. Disney created a character which is the wet dream of everyone who wants to gain billions of dollars by selling merchandise. I can't even like Baby Yoda because it All feels to calculated by Disney to make profit. They really do destroy the world of movies and shows when people believe this is high quality entertainment.

I'm really angry at this show. Still can't believe this high rating and the hype around it.

boring and dull
acedianomie1 February 2020
I like star wars movies but i'm not a fanboy. I found Mandalorian to be incredible boring and dull. I read some reviews and basically its star wars fanboys giving it 10's because of nostalgia and because of baby yoda.

I honestly can't remember the last time i was so bored with a tv series.

Episode 6 i felt like i was re-watching suicide squad.

Starts great but by ep 4 all is lost
waneagony4 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
The show started out promising for the first three episodes. Great atmosphere, CGI, and really captured the old StarWars feel. Pedro Pascal does a good job as The Mandalorian.

Then came episode 4. The acting by most of the villagers in episode 4 was like watching a children show on Disney Channel. Awful. Unfortunately this bad acting (especially by the younger actors) persisted from episode 4 and forth.

Other bad stuff is the inconsistency of how good a fighter The Mandalorian is. Sometimes he's great (like in the very first scene in episode 1) and then after that he gets his back kicked by almost everyone (makes me wonder what's with all the hype about being Mandalorian by the other characters in the show). Another thing is killing a Mudhog with a 4 inch knife. Really? I'm sure there are some super properties withe a Mandalorian knife, but they are never explain this in the show.

Finally, the Mandalorian does not have much of a story to tell. It's more of a per episode adventure show. Might work for some, but all this made me lose interest by the very poor episode 4 - and I never regained it.

It looks, feels, and is Star Wars.
itsdaveeed12 November 2019
Superbly done! Includes phenomenal writing, world building, directing, cinematography, editing, musical score, art direction, acting, sound mixing/editing, costumes, and it continues. Everything a Star Wars film should be. Not an easily digestible crowd-pleaser, but I suppose it will end up being a crowd-pleaser since it is so good.

Everything a Star Wars series or film should be. It expands and explores the reaches of the universe it is set in over an impactful period of time. A concept episodes 7 and 8 totally forgot.

It's also well written: a concept the prequels-and to a lesser extent the sequels-also forgot.

This is the return to form of Star Wars. The well-made, world building, lore-filled beast that is Star Wars.

weak scenario
ngpinpin1 December 2019
I'm a starwars franchise fan, and a Jon Favreau fan. I truly had great expectations when i saw the trailer. I thought that, wow, finally a spin-off with this legendary Mandalorian. Well, i'm really disappointed to discover a well directed but very weak story line, full of clichés... i think it's a scenario of a cartoon for a 5-year-old. And i find very disturbing to see a main character wearing a helmet and you can't see his face for more than 2 episodes... You can't see any emotion nor actor's skill even with a beautifully designed mandalorian helmet... I hope that the production can find new writers to improve the show...

'The Man with No Name' in space. Cowboy western in galaxy.
amnanzul3 December 2019
This is exactly how I imagine if Clint Eastwood's The Man with No Name is in space.

The way Mandalorian act himself also reminds me of a cowboy, specifically the Man with No Name or the inspiration of that which was originally Yojimbo.

The right man at the wrong place doing the right thing because he needs to.

Okay, it's only 3 episodes, but..
alvarhaggis25 November 2019
...it's wonderful. True to the saga. A dirty, gritty, violent world. It is steeped in its spaghetti western in space beginnings.

I can't speak highly enough of the production values, but we wouldn't expect anything less from a big Disney production.

My only complaint, is the episodes are a little short, and one a week! I'd maybe wait till there was more to watch than the current 3 episodes, as you'll definitely be wanting more.

I was born the day Star Wars was released in 1977. It's been there my whole life. Only Rogue One has captured that original feeling of the old, in the new breed of movies. This series also belongs there. Annoyingly shows how you can use modern tech and graphics, and still have it feel as authentic towards ,and like it belongs with, the originals.

Spaghetti western meets sci-fi soap opera. Its exactly as it sounds. More action packed than a normal star wars movie, and a little more dark. The first 3 episodes are better than all the sequels combined! I'd love to see more!

They neutered s bad ass bounty hunter
deanbean31722 January 2020
I'm going to make this brief, I expected the Mandalorian to have more of a Punisher vibe. I guess that was asking too much of a Disney-fied Star Wars universe. To be fair, there was an unexpectedly high body count for the House of Mouse, but there were other times when the Mandalorian would have definitely killed an opponent, yet he let them live, which felt totally untrue to the character. Other times he makes obviously foolish choices which lead to bad situations, the only reason being that the bad situation leads to a fight scene which only serves to pad an already-too-short running time. Still, I hold out hope that maybe the next season will be better. I have spoken.

Such a different feel yet recaptures all the original magic.
sounakc-9897117 November 2019
Perfection in every department, casting, the music, the intriguing characters, beautifully shot. It's so engaging, has elements of the Leone westerns, Indy callbacks, yet so fresh in its approach. Very smart storytelling not stopping to explain every location and detail, definitely created by a die hard Star Wars fan-Favreau. Can't wait for the next chapter. The sequel movie trilogy is all over the place, hollow, lacks any emotional attachment with the fans, glad we finally have this. 10/10.

Just like the Star Wars of old
chris-471116 November 2019
I am a 52 year old brit who grew up with Star War since I was 10 years old, yeah it started that long ago!! I've seen all the films more than once and been more dissapointed the further series goes, except for Rogue On, but this reminds me of when I was a 10 year old and I 1st saw a speeder, Millenium Falcon or a Star Destroyer.

Yeah it's full of CGI and it's well done but it has the feel of the the original. I really hope it continues this way and does not get carries away with itself.

This is how Star Was was meant to be!

Read this to save your time (if you care)
kuarinofu25 January 2020
Looks like they finally got someone to re-watch the original trilogy.

They copy the style very well to drag in the audiences that love that quaint look of SW: A New Hope. The Mandalorian doesn't look like the new trilogy films (which are very generic and their overall polish only hurts them). In this one they are really trying to push that grounded approach at first, but then just give up.

It starts off ok, nothing really impressive but fine. They really push the nostalgic look and provide some fan service for more hardcore fans.

At some point you start to wonder where's the story is going to kick in, but it never does. They just continue to dwell on the looks and the things you remember from the older films.

Each (short) episode has around 5 full minutes of the Mandalorian driving or walking somewhere. At times it feels like good trolling from the creators, when they just mock and laugh at some of the stupid things there are in SW, but most of the time it's just boring. There are also lots scenes that are just copied and pasted. You can do your business, walk out and come back and you're not going to miss anything important (or good dialogue).

The Mandalorian himself is not a character and he has a super generic uninspiring backstory that is obvious from the start. He has no personality so he can't really act out of character when he does something weird. He barely talks as well.

Absolutely nothing happens up until episode 7, when it sort of starts to pick up, but they gave the finale of the season to Taika Waititi so the last one is just a wacky comedy episode (because Waititi can't really do anything else). You can really see that everyone was having a good laugh in the last episode, Giancarlo Esposito's line delivery was priceless, it's like he tried so hard not to burst out laughing. Gina Carano is a strong woman but her acting hurts me. Thanks for Carl Weathers though, I enjoyed his performance in this nevertheless.

The writing just serves itself to progress the story, lots of things in this make absolutely no sense, the finale is especially horribly written and it's hard to feel any danger when everyone is invincible. It's funny that nobody told the "characters" that they are invincible since they act like they are in danger, when they are clearly not and they prove it multiple times.

The finale is anticlimactic and even the good memorable music theme can't save it. They also mess up the tone a couple of times when they play action score or a tense one over nothing.

I was ok with it being small-scale and it could've felt much closer to me and more real (and not super blown up like the new trilogy), but the writing was stupid and there was no story or characters. You can say that the Mandalorian is an empty shell intentionally but why make him your protagonist then?

The production was good and the CGI didn't bother me since it was good for a series.

The Mandalorian is a great pick to play in the background when you're doing something else, you can never miss anything because nothing happens. It's a perfect ambient video to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of SW without actually losing any substance (because there is none).

It really feels like they had an unfinished script for a full feature but then decided to water it down and break into a series with short episodes where nothing happens.

I binge-watched it only because of the hype and in my opinion it's insanely overpraised.

If you still want to see it you can watch episodes 1 to 3, 7 and 8. This will be enough to understand what it represents but you won't waste time for the fillers.

The Mandalorian with No Name...
genderarm17 January 2020
The show misses the mark on a number of levels, the Baby Yoda may have kept viewers thirsting for more, but poor dialog, threadbare plot, and lack of a real enemy throughout makes the show feel more like grinding for some eventual payoff.

The last episode may pay off, this is arguably due to the direction of Taika Watiti, director of Thor: Ragnarok. The season finale did pay off, but not enough to have made the show really connect on any level beyond the basic desire for Star Wars TV.

The Mandalorian code being so explicit and preachy really takes away from what seemed to be the intent of the show, and definitely what the driving musical score promises, the man with no name, in space.

Despite being a man a few words, the man with no name was rougish, with some level of self-interest always close at hand. He is a bounty hunter at heart. But he's not just any bounty hunter.

But the missing piece wasn't necessarily in the actions of the Mandalorian, they were in the lack of any dynamic antagonistic presence. There was no enemy turned ally turned enemy turned begrudging partner again. This failure is present in all but one episode.

The Mandalorian absolutely needs a Tuco and Angel Eyes. We get the strong silent type. His dialog is stilted instead of compelling, and no antagonistic relationship leads to no character dynamics necessary to make the character work.

Indeed, every enemy we come across who might be a constant thorn and driving force to the Mandalorian's roguishness has been neatly wrapped up by the end of the "chapter."

Imagine reading a book in which no chapter leaves you on the edge of your seat. That was my experience with the Mandalorian.

3 episodes in and we finally have real Star Wars. Great storytelling, characters and action. John Favreau and Dave Filoni can save the franchise...ss long as they don't do some insane concept or subvert your expectations crap. That'll turn these glowing reviews into 1-star critiques. Oh and patriarchy? Yeah the leader of the Mandalorian clan is a matriarch. Get over yourselves 😂

How is this universally praised? It's like a bad sci-fi show had a kid with a generic Disney Chanel show...

I came expecting something akin to Battlestar or Firefly, but got something I have trouble finding a comparison to.

Every single episode ends the same.

Episode 1 + 2 - Mando flies away in space Episode 3 - Mando flies away in space Episode 4 - Mando flies away in space Episode 5 - Mando flies away in space Episode 6 - Mando flies away in space

It's a meandering, boring mess that has failed on all fronts. At least on other episodic shows we get character development and maybe an entertaining story, but neither is present. The characters are all boring, except Baby Yoda, but what has the guy done since episode 2?

Who is watching this garbage!!!

Visually beautiful (and it is Star Wars) but tedious in every other way
neahga17 December 2019
Filled with terrible acting by unnecessary and unwanted cameos, story-lines so threadbare that they make gold leaf look like ingots, and a complete and utter lack of any sort of drama, main character threat, crêpe paper characters, etc.

It is visually beautiful, adds much needed expansion and grit to the Star Wars universe, and surfs that nostalgia wave expertly while blithely overlooking major plot holes.

Fun to watch, but increasingly disappointing the longer it lasts.

Would be ranked much lower except for the visual and nostalgia factors.

Your dream of a gritty Star Wars Western has been Disneyfied ... poorly
h0b0p1316 December 2019
This show is extremely disappointing. Visually, it's decent for the first few episodes. The writing is horrendously bad, and really quite cringeworthy: 'It's four of us versus one of you' 'I like those odds' Yeah, nice one, Mando. Several characters are actually actively annoying whenever they're on screen, and the acting in general is pretty flat.

After the first 3 episodes, all plot progression and character development stops entirely. It's just a man and a baby flying around space. Things happen to them which are resolved within the episode, and nothing carries over to the next episode. They don't even develop the relationship between the only two consistent characters - their interactions consist entirely of Mando picking up baby Yoda to put him down again somewhere else, or baby Yoda looking at things. This hasn't developed at all over 5 episodes of them being together so far.

It also drops off a bit visually after the first 3 episodes and the locations become less detailed, filming is less dynamic, there is more kind of meh CGI and even makeup. This really feels like Disney wanted to push this out before they even had a show ready to be made. If you want to watch a children's show, there are plenty different ones out there with actually good writing.

What are other people watching?
m-doran15 December 2019
I must be watching a different series to what others have been watching, 9/10? No way. This is an over hyped series, story line is, well, basically awful and the acting is so bad. I can't actually think of a positive to say about it, it's that bad. During episode 6 I made the comment to my wife that it feels like it has been written by a school kid.

I used to love Star Wars, until The Last Jedi and from the trailers I had high hopes for The Mandalorian, but its such a disappoint. I'll watch the whole series in the hope it will spring to life, but I won't hold my breath.

Welcome home Star Wars! It's Good to See You Again!
deanocware22 November 2019
Being what most would call a casual Star Wars fan I have begrudgingly watched the sequel feature films hoping to experience the awe and wonder... a little bit of moxy..that I did when I first saw Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader and Princess Leia. I am now 51 years old and no Star Wars product since the original series has been able to do that for me...until now. Before the Mandalorian I never knew what it was that I "loved" about Star Wars. It wasn't the special effects, costumes or even universe. Yes I loved the characters but Star Wars was always more than any one character. With the Mandalorian I have finally realized what it was that I loved. The genre. Spaghetti western in space! There is something about the Star Wars universe George Lucas created that elevates the genre. Even with a totally unknown character and obscure race like the Mandalorians when used to tell an authentically "Star Wars" story I love it. I finally feel like this show picks up where the original trilogy left off. Seeing classic Star Wars aliens like the Jawas doing actually being Jawas just renewed something in me about this franchise. Welcome home Star Wars. I hope you will stay for a while!

Not impressed, a little bored
tjmf-664547 December 2019
I find the story so far - Not to be of the standard I expected when going into it, with it being Disney and Star Wars and all. The dialogue is sparse/weak, and the Mandalorian in particular, he sounds like a bad fortune cookie especially when he's talking to fellow Mandalorians. It feels like nothing much is happening and that fans are expected to love it for Yoda, droids, and Mandalorians being in it. The show looks like it was needlessly made on a cheap budget. So like with the original movie, they've tried to get the most out of it - through clever camera work and effects, while going with a rustic, dusty, vibe.

For anyone who's wondering what it's about, it's about a bounty hunter in a galaxy far far away, yeah, sounds cool, but they haven't pulled it off.

I'm on episode 5 on season 1. I'm giving the rating now because I feel others have hyped the show too early. I hope that it's a slow start and then, unexpectedly, we get blown away. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan so am looking at it like a stand alone series, and I reckon I'm being kind in giving it a 5 rating. I'll change it if it takes off, but, it'll need a lot more than a Roger Rabbit character bouncing around the screen.

Linear story, cheesy writing, and lazy plot. The cute baby yoda is the only thing keeping this afloat. Remove the star wars name and the hype is gone.

Hugely overrated.
benprichardsdotcom23 January 2020
The first three episodes are pretty good. We have a mysterious, intriguing main character. Exciting setups and solid Star Wars visuals, then Baby Yoda comes along. I love Baby Yoda but for some reason The Mandalorian became the Baby Yoda Show and the writing went down faster Snokes story arc.

Episodes four, five and six are very lame. Not much happens of any note apart from the dumbing down and degrading of the titular main character. Then came the last two episodes: utter garbage, absolute drivel. Such lazy, terrible and unforgivable writing.

The Mandalorian reminds me of The Boys: brave and bold in the beginning. Then turns crap.

A man with a plan, cohesive story and that all important understanding and respect for Star Wars.
toby_hawk29 December 2019
When I heard that Filoni and Favreau were involved I got excited. Jon absolutely nails the ethos and feel of the star wars universe in both tone and lore useage.

While Filoni let the storywriting down a little on his own written episode (5, though the Easter eggs are a fanboy's paradise) the episode he didn't write but directed (1) was a perfect way to set the tone for the series. With some experience directing live action, he could be great.

Deborah Chows episodes (3 and 7) are standout episodes, only being bested by Waititis PERFECT finale (8) and narrowly beating episode 2 and 1 respectively.

Disney.

Please learn your lesson.

Star Wars is not a formula.

It requires careful storywriting, respect for the characters and knowledge of the lore in the galaxy.

Just imagine if you'd plotted all 3 of the new trilogy movies out before you went out to shoot them. You could have had an entirely different beast.

Give Favreau and Filoni the keys and a blank check book... Oh... And give them Revan / KOTOR.

The Mandalorian is Star Wars at its best.

Its Finally happened
alphallama19 November 2019
Disney has finally produced a absolutely must not miss show that has a real star wars feel to it. No agendas. No assasinations of classic star wars loved characters. This show really does prove that its still possible to make good star wars content. A deep felt thanks to all the people involved in making this show. It really has made my year.

Very disapointing
alexandre-paulo10 December 2019
There is no story line, each episode is a disconnected short story that feels like a poor remake of Spaghetti Westerns.

"The good the bad and the ugly" became chapters 1-3 "The magnificent seven" (1960) became the "The magnificent two"? (Chapter 4: Sanctuary)

Really??? I just don't understand the high ratings on this... unless are paid reviews of are from millenials that know nothing of classic movies

This is Star Wars now: Plot holes, unnecessary fan-service and predictable.
badoli12 December 2019
The biggest issue of this series is the fact that the protagonist doesn't talk much and you hardly see his face. Often during the series i had no idea what he was feeling or thinking and as such a lot of his actions came out of the blue. This led to a lot of confusing "Oh, ... This is happening now...?"-moments.

But even if you retro-fit his emotions into a lot of scenes, it doesn't make his actions more understandable or believeable. He does bad things and good things, but i have no idea wether he enjoys or dreads them. He kills some without remorse and protects others without apparent reason. After three episodes i still have no idea what the character of the mandalorian is. I'm not even sure it's Pedro Pascal under that helmet.

The whole show is written for spectacle, not for a good narrative. Only from that point of view everything becomes painfully clear and predictable. If you strip away the Star Wars scenario, you're left with a weak gunslinger story. It's even more apparent when you look at the side characters, which feel lifted from a cheap 60ies western series. At times the writing is on the level of an average videogame, which in contrast don't depend on good screenplay.

As such it's up to the scenario to carry the bulk of atmosphere building. This isn't done too sensibly either, several times Star Wars is shoved into your face without consideration for the world. Most of it is recycled from Episode 4 to 6, so oldtimer fans will approve. The amount of really original designs on the other hand is rather low, i guess a lesson learned from the newer movies.

All in all another Star Wars disappointment for me. Which is really sad, as the production values are great! The world looks believeable and amazing. The camera work is decent. But that alone is not Star Wars. This is Disney's Star Wars: A safe but lacking rehash of tried and proven ideas.

Maybe I am watching another movie....
sivex24 November 2019
After looking at the ratings for the movie I watched first 3 episodes. The movie overall is just average, with poor acting, scarcity and no consistency; not solid at all. It does not succeed in giving any emotion like firsts Star Wars movies. You want to continue watching just to see what will happened next, not for the intrinsic value of the movie.

Fresh & Gritty. Watch this. I have spoken.
ElectrifiedToast26 November 2019
Finally a Star Wars that feels like it's not just there to peddle merch to kids.

I binged through the first 3 episodes last night and have to say it's spot on. Welcome to a dark gritty Star Wars with perfect attention to detail. The blend of puppet characters and CGI is done perfectly, they nailed it. There are many things that stay true and relate to the original Star Wars so it feels very honest in many regards.

Production quality is top notch, like top notch for a movie let alone a series. Editing was good, my only minor (petty?) criticism is there were some slightly '"too-fast-too-many-cuts" during one shoot out scene. Overall it's well shot and flows smoothly.

The plot is fairly basic but when you have a main character that barely says anything then there's limited scope. You also don't see his face (and presumably never will) so it's hard to connect with the character. That being said, it all works and Pedro Pascal is able to inject sufficient humanity in when needed.

Some provided background into the Mandalorians themselves would have been good for the uninitiated but as with the whole thing; the series feeds you enough tidbits of information to keep it all flowing.

Hopefully the story doesn't cause the grittiness, rawness and in many regards savageness to degrade. If the remaining episodes can keep on as the first three then we're on to something good here. In many ways I'm surprised Disney gave this the green light but I'm so glad they did.

Now, if we could just see an episode where he shoots Jar-Jar Binks in the face...

Peak Star Wars
magdreamer24 November 2019
This is perhaps my favorite addition to Star Wars lore since the Old Republic Sagas in Knights of the Old Republic games. The characters are interesting. The story is thrilling. The fights are exciting. The filming is excellent. The music is - AMAZING.

The goosebumps that episode 3 gave me is not what I've grown to accept is the new norm from Disney, which is anything from okay to utterly disappointing. The story built up from episode 1 - 3 never left me hanging, but yet somehow paid off unexpectedly well.

I'm so happy with this series. I hope it keeps on giving.

The lost Star Wars atmosphere has finally returned!
busnegcc24 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I've just been through the first 3 episodes and I'm feeling like something has just come back from the old star wars.

The visual, the atmosphere, the mandalorians of the last episode and everything I missed is back. The storytelling fits perfectly with the lost style of the old expanded universe, finally a show that brings back that sense of amazement that we felt the first time we watched Star Wars.

Thanks Dave, thanks Jon, you are doing great!

Lame, Cheap "Direct-to-video" Star Wars.
Android14 November 2019
Boba fett costume, stormtroopers...The familiar Star Wars stuff we love have completely brainwashed viewers into thinking this is good. It's Star Wars reduced to "B" level tv sci-fi. Like a 90s space network show. Terribly directed. No tension, no drama, weak action, dull acting, weak "intrigue", nothing compelling at all. You get wall-to-wall fan service. That's it. I'd call it big budget fan fic but I don't even see a big budget. Star Wars should be top tier. This is barely middle tier. Disney messed up so badly they cancelled all theatrical films. Boba fett movie, gone. Obi wan movie, gone. Mediocre "direct-to-video" Star Wars is what we get instead. My 3 kids watched it, 6-8-10...their reaction: meh...put on a marvel movie. Nice going Disney. Kids don't care about Star Wars. It's no longer special.

What is this show actually about?
chatorech8 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This series is absolutely terrible. It has zero story and absolutely no Star Wars feeling. It seems basically like an aimless Western where the main character simply wanders about without any specific reason. Why did they put a baby Yoda there? To sell toys at some point. Is there any real reason why it is there? It seems not even the writers know. Last episode they went to Tatooine for some reason, why exactly? For us hardcore Star Wars fans to feel nostalgia and like the series? The whole series seems extremely low quality as well, the acting and actors are not very good and the dialogues are pathetic. This is supposed to be Disney+ tentpole show, kinda like Game of Thrones for HBO and Stranger Things for Netflix, yet it does not even come near to the quality of either of those shows. I am a huge Star Wars fan and at this point I am just super disappointed, I had really high expectations for this show....

Not aimed at adults
aristidelebreton2 December 2019
The Mandalorian doesn't deserve 1/10 but neither does it deserve 9/10, far from it.

It's Star Wars alright: the production is good, the musics, the sounds... you feel right at home.

But it doesn't go farther than that. So far 4 episodes in and the writing is... bad. Well, not "bad", but clearly not targeting adults. Trying to follow most events with an adult brain will make you want to facepalm much too often and your suspension of disbelief is challenged at every action scene.

So yeah, it's actually a nice and well produced kid/teenager show but if you're after a more mature take on Star Wars (like Rogue One was), steer far away from this one.

Utterly brilliant in every way
medavecochran2 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
The Mandalorian is superb, this is what new star wars material should aim to be. The characters are developed enough for you to actually care about them. The story's are good. I've read some reviews that state certain episodes were like fillers, episode 6 the prisoner being one, but in my perception was that every episode was top class and there was very little fat on the series. I love the feel of every episode and baby Yoda is brilliant, the whole thing feels worn and real unlike the the new trilogy. I can't wait until the next series. This is the way!! More please.... 👍

Writing needs work
heatsink9813 November 2019
The first episode was a quick & somewhat unpolished intro to the series. Writing didn't go very deep on anything we saw. The usual guidelines for pro storytelling were forgotten in some scenes, which led to story elements being too easy and/or rushed to get where we were going. Here's hoping things get better.

Wonderful!! The downside = short episodes
ToddynMissy22 November 2019
Wonderful, store episodes in and there's so much potential to go several seasons.

The biggest downside for me is struggling with about 30 minute episodes and having them a week apart.

My suggestion / wish would be full-length episodes (43-60 min) and maybe doing like AppleTV+ did by releasing a few (3) at the beginning of the season then roll them out weekly. It "seems" to be a good balance for the "binge" minded and those who like to pace themselves.

The above said, Thank you Disney - great show. I literally bought a year of Disney* just for this one show (I own all the movies already) - though, I am looking forward to some of your other upcoming series' too.

It could be a great story, but...
lechootek1 December 2019
When I saw Chapter One and Two, I thought 'Wow, Love it!'. But with next one, my hope for something refreshing and unique began to fly away. Now, after Chapter Four, my respect and faith in true fine story is ruined... It was so childish and so shallow that I was really happy when it reached the end. Maybe I had too big expectations, but since I saw first SW trilogy back in 80' and last times the SW Stories I thought there's a chance. That's why in my opinion The Mandalorian COULD be the great TV series, but the story has to be more adult, more complicated. Or the US people don't need to think and have the reflection of what they saw?

Thank god! the episodes last only 30 minutes
chnutscher30 November 2019
Thank god! the episodes last only 30 minutes

My second review here. This serie really gives me a good laugh. While with S01E04 we get a glimpse of Kurosawas 7 samurai, this episode should have crushed any illusions left to where this show goes. It's not an outlier, it's the program! Simplistic one-dimensional episodes with practically no story, but fantastic graphics and settings. I begin to believe other writers saying that originally this serie was intended to be a computer game, where the single quests were commuted into episodes here.

As for Pedro Pascal. Can we be sure it's him? I mean, could be anybody just walking around and jump occasionally. I guess the wage is good, this must have been the easiest job in a while, as there is no need to act at all.

And as written earlier, the very single events of each episode are stretched over and over. Imagine what additional boredom would be created it the episodes lasted 45min or even 1 hour.

I remain amused about this serie and will follow just to see where it leads.

So Dissapointed!
revnatorade17 December 2019
I was very excited when I saw the trailer for this new Star Wars Show. I'm a huge fan of Jon Faverau and Dave Filoni so I assumed this would be a win for die hard fans, I was wrong. We are 6 episodes in and there is no character development, bad acting, music that doesn't fit the franchise and no plot progression. Every episode follows the same story beat, show up for a bounty, get double-crossed, protect baby Yoda, win the fight fly off to the next mission. It just sucks! The only thing Star Wars that Disney has done right is Rebels! That show is the best Star Wars out there since the original trilogy. I would say that I'm shocked that Disney greenlit the second season but, with all of the money that they will make from selling baby Yoda merchandise, they can afford to keep churning out garbage.

Frenchise reborn and better than ever
forgacs_b2 January 2020
-no spoilers-

I've waited until the first season is over to arrange my thoughts.

I've been a star wars fan since my childhood. As a millenal I'm that "liking the prequels" type (the debut of the first episode was my turning point towards star wars). I was super excited about episode 7 and bringing back my favourite universe to cinema, but it was a huge turn-down. As time passed I got to the point where I wasn't even interested in seeing upcoming films (from 8 on).

But when I saw the first poster of the mandalorian, I was immediately drawn. This whole Mad max/desert cowboy/ bounty hunter theme seemed exciting from the beginning.

Excellent writing of the story. Finally someone in this universe understands how to shape characters, involve developement and build tension that keeps you addicted to watch more. It brings new, never seen before elements to the table in a setup filled with plot twists, epic fight scenes and emotions.

THIS is how you Star Wars! I honestly hope that we get to see more movies and series like this and move on to forget the 3 new films to set up a new era.

Anyway I absolutely recommend for every fan and newcommers, but the internet is already filled with how great the serie is. If you happen to read this enjoy, and may the force be with you!

Finally.....
tecnogaming26 November 2019
Finally, a simple story, told in simple terms. No excessive dialog, in fact, very sparce. Focusing on a single guy, and probably 1 other secondary cast but that's about it.

At last, a series that shows how storytelling should work. No need to be politically correct, no need to add BS so everyone insecure person on the planet feels happy. NO need to add extra useless dialog, no need to add explanations that treats the viewer as a moron. No need to add things that do not contribute to the character development... no need for stupid faces, stupid lines, stupid scenes.

The series is short, the story could be told in 10 minute, episodes feel short even with a short story, much emphasis on making you feel like you're there. The 80's vibe is all over the place but not imposed on you, it feels like it's flowing, really flowing, product of intelligent minds running the project.

No need to spoil things for you, this is how all the movies post Chapter IV, V and VI should had followed. This is how starwars stories should be told, Solo movie being the worst of them all.

This is how star wars is felt on videogames, this is how you make a masterpiece.

This is just so good - - Disney please give next trilogy to Feloni
gnev-4654122 November 2019
I had hopes for the show, but was blown away by how good it is. This is the best we have seen in the Star Wars uiniverse since Revenge of the Sith, even though The Clone Wars were great too and Rogue One was very good.

Feloni and team just know the essence of what made/makes Star Wars great. Up to every little aspect of it. Actually why I have little hope for the next movie (sorry Disney), I am even more excited for the next Mandalorian.

PLEASE DISNEY if someone of you should read this - give a Trilogy to Feloni & Team - and just let him dot it without any marketing interference - he deserves it - the FANS will reward you! Probably the Old Republic?

XweAponX17 November 2019
THAT was cool!

I just got done with the 2nd episode, and things are rapidly falling into place.

This is like watching sections of any given Star Wars movie (the best parts) every week. I wasn't expecting this kind of production value. On this scale.

My only complaint? The episodes are too short! Should be longer.

Regardless of that, I look forward to more episodes of this.

I have a really bad feeling about this...
namob-4367312 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This is based on the first two episode only.

Okay, so this is better than TLJ, and of course miles better than Solo. No surprise there, I mean what isn't? The first episode is also decently cool, decently done, with average effects, and I even laughed at a BBQ meal. The second starts with the worst choreographed fight scene I think I have ever seen, and than dumb shit with pointless fan service throughout.

Sadly "average" is the word of the day. This has that B-show feel, with B-show average effects and average acting, and I fail to see anything special about the show so far. Worst though is that we have seen these episode many times before. Every scene we have seen before. It is like they have copy pasted one scene from that movie and/or TV show, and another scene they copy pasted from another movie and/or TV show and so on and so forth.

We have a couple of really bad moments such as trying to ride a whatchamacallit which of course is the only way to get to O.K. Corral moment with all the "bad guys" and their storm-trooper-aiming. When 30 soldiers with laser-guns cannot hit their target 20 meters away I call complete and utter BS. I think 15 blind grandmas would have hit their target more often. Another really bad scene from the second episode the Mandalorian fights Jawas in such a cringe way I almost gave up there and then. And of course that horrible 2nd episode keep getting worse and worse.. by the end I was laughing at how bad it was. I kept wishing they would feed that useless "baby" after midnight and pour some water on him. Perhaps that would make this show more watchable.

Another thing to mention is the music and sounds score, which is so atrociously bad I often find myself turning it off or using my own sound effects. Seriously? Who made this crap? Ludwig Göransson? Ah, that explains that... How did they made a Star Wars TV show this bad? Darth Kennedy is involved as executive producer so that explains a lot...

I have now basically giving up. I will probably check out the next episode to confirm this suck, after that moving on to better things such as clipping my toe nails or watching paint dry on a golf course.

I give the first episode a 5/10 and the second 2/10... in total so far 3.5/10... but I think that is generous, and I have a really, really bad feeling about this...

KIds show?
jlseagull-jonno16 December 2019
I actually love kids shows, so comparing this to a kids show offends me. The robot in episode 1 was the best character, but Mandork killed him. Then having baby yoda help kill the beast in episode 2 makes me hope that this "yoda" is dark side. There have been plenty of shows that started out shaky but had stronger 2nd or third seasons, so i that's my hope. Space-comedy-westerns like Firefly are my favorite, but this didn't hit any of those marks. It is a travesty that such a huge brand can't get it right in the last. I would have given it a 2 or 3 star, but holy cow do i wish i could see the show at is getting all of these 9's and 10's.

Just "meh" and frustratingly poor after ep 3
RedMars20178 December 2019
The opening 3 episodes are great. It reminds me of the joy in watching Rogue One - an original story set in the Star Wars universe. Then episodes 4 and 5 are so bad, it's like watching a Nickelodeon teen sci-fi. So after 5 episodes, we have 2 pointless fillers, with no plot or character development. Utter shambles. For a first season to be drop the ball after 3 episodes is unforgivable.

You have to wonder about the sheer amount of identical 10/10 reviews headed with "This is Star Wars" and "Star Wars is back!". All from the same review farm, paid for by Disney? Or different reviewers with about as much original ideas as the writers of this show.

Started off good, then episode 4 came along...
Lundeman2 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The show was built up to be a great show. Like Star Trek in the Star Wars universe. After having seen episode 4 I'm not so sure I will like were the show is headed.

They brought in "dingus" and "goofer" the wacky stick-fighting duo who made the episode feel like a bad comedy from some random sitcom. They also brought in "Strong Woman", because they need a STRONG INDEPENDENT WOMAN, flipping an armored person of over 100kg like it was paperweight. So she is of some form of decent from humans that have evolved superhuman strength. And what would the episode be without a shallow and baseless 1-episode love story between the hero and a damsel in distress.

First 3 episodes were decent enough. Probably the best Star-Wars related content Disney has ever produced. It's integrity managed to be broken in just a single episode. Sad.

better than the last movies
mov13junk1327 December 2019
I dig what Jon Favreau tried to do here, but the story is rather medicore while the visual design is always on point. i enjoy this show definetly more than the last star wars movie but i cant relate to the overhyped ratings, maybe the previouse bad movies have made fans so numb that they now treat a mediocre show as excellent since disney had set the bar so low in regards to storytelling. it seems, if you invent some new cute aliens and some stylish new hero-characters, slap the starwars-logo on you can merchendise the hell out of it, people will gladly spent theire money on it no matter the story. unless this changes, disney will not change and will continue to deliver mediocre storytelling.

The Best Star Wars! in the entire universe so far!
stormt-8056923 November 2019
Finally after all these years! A real Star Wars episode! Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni are the future of Star Wars!!!!

ANH, ESB & RTJ - Originals! Everything after that was a mess!

These has hit high to the real essence of George Lucas's real vision back so long ago!

This feels current enough without losing the real essence of Star Wars! Masterpiece of a show, well done!

This has to be the future going forward!

Disney took a note from biowares' The Old Republic
Sjark22 November 2019
And The Old Republic got it all right.. they had the brilliant smuggler story, and the cringe that it turns out the jedi stories generally are, which brought the light on the more interesting stories, the sith villains by all means, but also the more beautifully subtle character of the imperial agent, and in our case; the mercenary bounty hunter. The latter, clearly the inspiration of The Mandalorian, right down to his ship and armor. Neither good nor evil, simply living by an honor code, whether personal.. or as it turns out clan. I am exhilerated where this might lead Disney, as this is taking from the star wars lore in a way that isn't at the same time gleefully pissing into it.. like what they did to Luke Skywalker and the blue milk scene.. I like The Mandalorian, I really do.. it's not technically a 10/10 for me, but they need the indicator, that they're on the right track towards perhaps redeeming the franchise. Don't let me down.. again!

Everything Star Wars Fans Have Been Hoping (and Asking) For
Fiahm18 November 2019
So I've just finished watching the first two episodes of The Mandalorian, which I'm pleased to report are grand - everything Star Wars fans have been hoping (and repeatedly asking) for since Return Of The Jedi, really, all those years ago. It's like Jar-Jar and bratty Anakin and the midichlorians and all the current SJW Disney movie abominations never happened. So far not one bit of identity politics has been crowbarred in, it's instead been simply lots and lots of what the fans actually want: plausible action and adventure unfolding in an intriguing and respectful manner in a story that further explores and deepens the universe they love.

If there's a fault, it may actually be that it crowd-pleases too much, at the expense of originality and character development: the bounty hunter himself is at present a bit of a blank space with nothing recognisably his own to set him apart from all the other stormtroopers and Boba Fetts of the past. The lack of facial features also adds to the feel of him being simply a video game avatar, and the whole show feels very comic book-like in its simplicity, but in a very entertaining way that the movies have been missing for so long.

I don't know where it's going to go, and it could all collapse into the usual virtue-signaling garbage even before the end of the first season, but putting Jon Favreau at the helm of it has so far been an inspired move and offers up a potential approach for the future that may even wind up saving the franchise. If Disney knew what they were doing they would oust Kathleen Kennedy tomorrow and put Favreau in charge of tightly overseeing anything with the words 'Star Wars' attached.

What the...
akaslammin24 November 2019
This is the most underwhelming and clumsily made tv program I've seen in a long time. It's predictable, full of cliches and has the depth of post it note. Indeed the plot seems to have been written on a post it note.

It is so mundane and slow it reminds me of watching an ice cube melt in a empty scotch glass; and this show is just like the disappointment you get when no matter how hard you try to to convince yourself it to be fine single malt when you taste the liquid it is just tasteless, boring and still slightly cold water.

The characters are charmless, and have no appeal or connection to the viewers, they are as two-dimensional as the plot. They are more like faded chalk outlines of the real characters that were found at the bottom of the abandoned 10 story building after they read script.

There are a number of reviews that suggest their is some nostalgic appeal to this show. The only nostalgia is in the shoddy and low key special effects. I'm not sure if they used the scenes and models that were not good enough to make the cut in the original Star Wars or they wasted all the $100m+ going through the Lucas' old rubbish bins to make the dusty old sets. Either way the terribleness of the special effects and sets match the terribleness of the plot and writing.

The only thing that Is hard to criticize is the acting. I suspect that is because nearly all the actors are either wearing masks or are robots.

In short this tv show seems to be written by a 10 yr old, directed by their 13 yr old sibling, with special effects done by their parent in the garden shed to show to their 18 fans on their fledgling YouTube channel.

Why? I know why.
andrutzzu_1013 November 2019
A mediocre first chapter ... Bad action, very bad action. No story, no atmosphere, no small locations .. You get the impression that it was shot on sets. This series seems made by TNT, but with good cgi effects and special effects. From the trailers I thought this series is great, but it looks like a mediocre series cheaper, with no sense whatsoever. . Many have nothing to do with filmmaking. I have seen over a thousand movies and serials .. Others have not even seen 50..and this series they find incredible .. It is in a logical way for them to say that.

xwhyzed23 December 2019
I don't know where the overhyped 10/10 reviews are coming from. The original idea is great and the first 2 episodes were good but it's going downhill really fast. They should immediately fire the writers because they have little to no imagination. The lowest point was episode 4 with zero originality, completely illogical character behaviors and terrible acting.

Half-baked.
wolfghostninja22 December 2019
I feel like Lucas Arts should get more credit than it generally recieves for the unbelievable consistency that it churns out top notch visuals and special effects. The aunthenticity and passion that goes into driving Star Wars's effects are almost peerless.

The production values behind this show are fantastic and it really is pretty. Dave Filoni should be congratulated and also offered condolences. Many fans, including myself, have fantasised of what a live-action Filoni production would bring to the table, and it doesn't disappoint intially. But the show has the main protagonist behind a helmet most of the time, making it very difficult to read the character. This is probably why Boba Fett is so mysterious in films, but also why he features so little.

I didn't think this made for compelling viewing and was exacerbated by dialogue that was infantile at points. I understand the desire to capture new younger fans, but ultimately this is a deliberate watering down of the show to its detriment.

I had expected a more mature production - more violence and slighlty darker, but the show seems aimed at a slightly naive audience. The subject matter - the galaxy's most dangerous bounty hunter - allows for more freedom in that regard. In retrospect, it appears Filoni, after decades of making cartoons (very very very good cartoons) was not ready to exploit this title.

For me its a miss by a cautious Disney, but having said that, I am very happy to see the rest of the community enjoying Star Wars again, genuinely pleased people have given this such a high rating, its just that personally it was all too PG for me.

Amazing, but almost too Disney-ish
TheTopDawgCritic30 November 2019
For a TV series, the props, sets and S/VFX are amazing, and 4 episodes in, the stories are well written and directed, but I find the dialogue and some action scenes a little too cheesy in some episodes - too Disney-ish meant for a much younger audience. I hope that improves over time for the original old-school audiences. Nevertheless, love the prequel concept and little Yoda is so cute, I want one! 8/10 from me.

Trying to play on nostalgia. Nothing else
varun-ismu17 November 2019
Its official..... Disney has killed the soul of Star Wars. The show only tries to engage viewers by playing on nostalgia. Lead character has no personality, poor voice, poor action sequences. A robot may have generated more empathy.

Special effects are on movie level which shows the amount of money Disney pumped into this. Had they gone with something unique after all its an entire galaxy to play with. But no they want you to see only what the originals had.

My main problem is Disney's interpretation of the Force. For them Force is like X-Men powers. Ithink George Lucas laid a very clear understanding of Force. But who can blame Disney, after all they are into Superheroes.

I would rather watch something original. Their new trilogy was a abomination. This one is even worsr.

Where is the common sense?
endemus-8807412 January 2020
Totally overrated serie, the storyline just doesn't add up. Especially the action scenes are chaotic, have no common sense. The only positive thing is the acting of the Mandalorian. The little gremlin (baby Yoda) is only cute, but it uses his (or her?) powers on strange moments. Overall not worth to pay for Disney+ only for this serie.

bimbimiller3 January 2020
I realy liked the mood of the first season. The story was little slow, but it never bothered me. It was like a cool sci-fi/western thing. (It reminded my boyfriend of the Firefly series.) The sets were great, excellent shootings at so many familiar places like Death Valley. If you like cuteness, there are some thing in it which will bring you round. And the music... I fell in love with it too much. :)

laurac-601432 January 2020
Give Favreau the keys to the Star Wars Universe. He understands what everyone else has been missing.

Looks and feels like Star Wars. Not at all like the let-down movies that say they are Star Wars.

Good start to The Mandalorian. DO NOT MESS THIS UP, Disney! You have restored our faith in Star Wars Universe by having Favreau take the lead.

Can't wait for Season 2!

KonradMoklev27 November 2019
Compared to the mini shows of star wars, this is a winner.

I saw most of the animated stuff, only worth to get a better story impact and some of the vibe. But the wild laser shooting is a little on the whatever side.

This has some true value. Could last longer for shure. 25 min.

Cant wait for the next one.

Beware of the fanboys!

S01E03 and already 517 reviews, mostly praising it to no end. Production value and settings are very good. Yes, definitely Star Wars. But the story? Almost no depth, with every single event stretched over and over. My prediction: with 5 episodes remaining, at the end of S01 one will realize that in fact almost nothing happend. On the best route to become a quite boring adventure ...

As others said, so far it feels like a comic. Where your are supposed to enjoy the graphics, while the dialogs are complementary just to provide the minimum informations in order to pretend that there is a story.

Wanted so much more STORY!
lhwallerich13 December 2019
Episode one sold me I was in for a new Stars Wars universe adventure. Each succeeding episode has gotten less and less interesting.

Not showing our hero's face may make the marketing of the Mandalorian exponentially easier on a global scale--only requiring the helmeted protagonist to change languages from country to country. But where's the story? What drives him? What hurts still eat at him? What love has he lost? Who does he hate?

Land on planet. Laser blast battle. Protect baby Yoda. Learn nothing of the Mandalorian's backstory.

Rinse and repeat. And repeat. And...

PhilipWhiteside16 December 2019
It's a story per episode, with no overarching storyline, so each episode feels like a waste of 30 minutes. With such short stories, they are predictable, corny, pointless. I really hoped this would be another great SciFi, but it's just not.

daillstate26 November 2019
This is why I love Star Wars! First 3 episodes have me laughs, chills, heroic idealism and that feeling of being a kid again! I go back to 1980 as a six year old with this fantasy. I'm in love once more! Will see if this states a 9 rating or if it goes up. It's darker than I'm used to with this franchise, but at least no Ewoks, so far lol Thank you to all who made this a reality.

Please watch this!
Gunsjoe25 November 2019
Please, please, please! This feels like it carries the soul of the famous knights of the old republic game from 2003 - except, you play as a Mandalorian instead of a Jedi.

This has all the components that made Star wars so likable namely : Wonder, Mystery, a dash of exploration, fun action, A sense of Fear and triumphant good clashing, Great sound track and most of all, a canon/series integrity.

This might actually make you angry as a side effect. How did Disney have this up their sleeve and do a horrible job with their movie trilogy? The answer is quite simple really - with this one, they seemed to have not listened to the PC crowd and their demands and made what they truly wanted. The movie trilogy on the other hand seems to have been developed on Tumbler by a bunch of PC principals.

A Childbook's Play
Tweetienator22 November 2019
It is disgusting how Disney & Co. flood Imdb with fake rates and fake reviews. The Mandalorian is okayish but nothing good. Maybe the kids will like it but the storyline is boring and predictable (reminds me of those childbooks with big pictures and here and there a few lines of words to describe what happens etc.) and got no more depth as all those animation movies for kids of the Star Wars franchise. Last but not least the characters are shallow like an empty glass, well, maybe the Mandalorian got one or two drops of water left. And I suspect they hired some guys and gals from DC or Marvel, cuz our Mandalorian fights like a superhero - even with the baby in his arms... All in all okay if you got nothing else to do and don't expect too much and you like to listen to the sound of blasters making bumbum.

Cringeworthy 1st Episode
kyle-802-57007113 November 2019
First, the tone and CGI in the first episode was good, and it feels like the Star Wars world. But man... this was cringeworthy. Every scene was very unoriginal, and the overall story was cliche. It was cheap on it's delivery in showing depth, and the characters felt so empty. Pretty much what you'd expect from Disney's overly simplified, formulaic storytelling.

Cringe
TomRuin5 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
Horrible. There is no other word to describe it. My biggest issue is the acting, I can't get through any episodes without cringing so bad. The characters are not likeable, I really don't care about their story or what happens to them. The action scenes are boring & the cgi is so low budget. The script makes me want to cry how cringe it is. The story line is lazy you can literally predict what's going to happen in every episode. Baby yoda was only put in to become a meme, without him the show would've failed. Random new force powers like healing ? Wow more plot holes. Wouldn't of Anakin liked to know that power to save Padme or obi wan to save qui gon.

Unorignal, Poorly Written, Monster of the Week
ivan-hawkes13 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I've watched the first 6 episodes, so feel it is appropriate to chime in with my thoughts.

The first two episodes set up what should be the season storyline with the discovery and rescue of baby yoda. It gives us a character who is working outside the boundaries of the law - a classic gun-slinger type, who lives by his own set of morals. It's all downhill from there.

Visually, the production is fine. It has a decent sized budget and so can afford reasonable props and costumes. What let's it down is the constant reference to classic Star Wars iconography e.g. the R2D2 probe to unlock doors. In episode 6 there were at least 4 scenes using nostalgia for the original shows to help propel interest in this one.

The acting is variable to say the least. The lead does well enough given the crippling trait of never being able to show his face. Other recurring actors tend to be fine, but the one off characters often feel B-grade or pantomime grade in their performances.

Characters are just pulled from cheesy archtypes and have no development. This is particularly true in episode 6 with the "heist" partners all feeling very generic. The worst of the lot would be the Twee who is constantly flicking her tongue around and playing with the stupid little knives that are supposed to define her character as "a knife guy". What use are knives against armoured robots and soldiers? Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Dialogue is loaded with exposition, and feels stilted and by the numbers. I don't think I've heard a single original line from any of them.

The story lines are simple and episodic and often stolen from much better films. No episode after 2 is really needed for continuity.

Episode 4 is a cut-down version of the Seven Samurai. Assemble a team (in this case just two people), train the villagers, set up some defences, fight off the impossible odds.

Episode 5 is the standard team up with someone young and incompetent for no good reason, then be betrayed by them episode.

Episode 6 is a heist voice where the objective is a prisoner, complete with the assembling of the team (short), the double cross, and the revenge on the double crossing team, and collection of the whole bounty by the hero. It's made particularly egregious because heist movie structure was parodied in Rick and Morty just this week.

I was expecting a lot more from this series. I didn't expect how awful much of the acting would be, the poor quality of the stories, or that is would instantly devolve into bottle episodes and monster of the week stories. This has a lot of potential, but is in the wrong hands and will never achieve that potential.

Watching this reminds me of how terrible the sequels are.
nmdx22 November 2019
10/10 Star Wars show, 8/10 TV show (e.g. compared to Breaking Bad, The Wire and Mr. Robot which are all 10/10).

Now how great would it have been if the sequels were actually created with the Star Wars spirit in mind? No repetition of Episode IV, no ruination of simple Star Wars physics, no dumb out-of-place humor?

Imagine the sequels were created based on the setting in The Mandalorian. The New Republic is struggeling but not so much that the whole plot of episodes 4-6 becomes worthless. Luke is rebuilding the Jedi Order. There's a menace that's actually not a replica of ep IV but maybe a rebuilding Sith Order or a splinter group.

At least we now have a good prequel- (Rogue One) and a good sequel-story (The Mandalorian).

A very mixed bag
hnt_dnl19 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
THE MANDALORIAN (2019-?) feels like the biggest thing since sliced bread. Star Wars fans are salivating over this new story involving the Boba Fett style warrior and his weekly journeys. After an immensely successful freshman season, it seems like the show has nowhere to go but up. I say that because I personally feel like there's a LOT that needs improvement, because I'm not seeing this masterpiece that virtually everyone else sees. A somewhat entertaining diversion, The Mandalorian is a very uneven mixture of action, sentimentality, comedy, catchphrases, and a bit too much fan service for my taste.

Cutting right to the chase, I'm going to say it...I DON'T like the main character!I feel like someone more imposing and intimidating should have been cast in the main role. I find Mando to be unimpressive, overly talky, and 1-dimensional. As the season progressed, I noticed a lot of fans were saying that Mando didn't talk much. Say what? lol The dude talks ALL THE TIME. And when he speaks, most of the time it's him trying to be funny with some dumb humor, like when he sprayed the Jawas with his fire rifle. And the guy looks frail and small. Even with all that armor, I don't see how his puny frame sustains it. No wonder Gina Carano could kick his ass so easily. Pedro Pascal's acting leaves a lot to be desired.

My next issue is this Baby Yoda subplot, in actuality, the ONLY plot for Season 1. The writers basically used gross manipulation to reel in viewers from the first episode. But in my opinion, that sabotages both Mando's character and the overall narrative. Barely feeling like a badass as is, this sappy BY stuff does Mando no favors. It may have resonated better if it weren't done in such a ham-fisted manner. See a cute baby=throw away my entire career and livelihood as a bounty hunter. Plus, there are major plotholes, like why was IG-11 going to kill BY when it was obviously so important to be brought in alive? That scene was literally set up so that Mando would have a reason to save the baby, but it was so unnecessary. Instead of slowly tapping into the sensitivity of Mando's character, the writers instead opt to go the easy route and cater to fans who lack patience for methodical storytelling and don't really care if their heroes have any depth or complexity.

Another thing is this bringing in all these random actors who desperately want to be a part of the Star Wars universe. It completely sabotages the story you want to tell because none of these people are in it for the long haul, so they pop in for an episode, say a few "funny" lines, then disappear. There's no cohesion or consistency. The show is like some cheap copy of The Fugitive because despite all the modern sheen of fancy effects and Star Wars brand, the acting is like a thousand times worse than it was in that classic series.

So why the 5 stars? Well, aside from the main character, there actually ARE several good ones, namely bail bondsman Greef Karga (excellently played by the iconic Carl Weathers), shock trooper Cara Dune (winningly played by the aforementioned Gina Carano), planetary farmer Kuill (terrific voice work by the great Nick Nolte), The Armorer (strongly played by the unseen Emily Swallow), Moff Gideon (superbly played by Giancarlo Esposito), IG-11, and last but not least the ex-Imperial Officer who paid the bounty (wonderfully played by Werner Herzog). The core supporting cast is pretty damn solid. Unfortunately, the writing did them no favors much of the time with dumb plot points, bad writing, and all of them being forced to play off of such a dull main character.

Another strong point to the series is the CGI. Yeah, at times there's a fake quality, but anything is better than that prequel nonsense. Everything looks real compared to that. The strong supporting cast, interesting locales, costume design, and that Star Wars "feel" are all there. But as I said, the show needs to improve in several areas to be the "masterpiece" that so many fans are already claiming it to be. It's definitely not there yet.

It is good not great
Chikiw6 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
I do like it but some episodes are just boring and some of the costumes are off. The finale also left me many questions? How did the Moff get the Darksaber? Last time we saw it was with Bo-Katan in Rebels. Why does the female Mandalorian tell them about the Old Republic Manalorians fighting against the Jedi? He called them an enemy and sorcerer. How doesn't he know about the Jedi? If he joined a Mandalorian house during the Clone Wars, he would know about the Siege of Mandalore and how the Jedi helped free Mandalore from Maul. Wouldn't the Rebel lady know about the Force? She was a Rebel Shocktrooper that probably heard about Luke Skywalker. There are probably more I can point out but I will not bore you.

It's okay...certainly not epic
Darkside624 January 2020
There was a ton of hype for this show and I really wanted to like it but it just didn't get there for me. It's extremely slow developing and several of the episodes could of been deleted and not have affected the overall story line. The acting and dialogue just felt forced and awkward at times. Other than the baby Yoda it's hard to care about any of the other characters which obviously includes the Mandalorian. Maybe next season will be improved but it's going to have to really step it up for me to watch.

Re-ignited my love for Star Wars
rikulahtinen2 December 2019
The Mandalorian isn't perfect by any stretch of imagination, but its lightyears ahead in world building and not breaking the existing universe compared to the sequel trilogy. I can't wait for new episodes to come out.

Episode 9 will be the last SW movie I watch before reading about it post release. In case it is as much of a dumpsterfire as TLJ, I can watch Chapter 8 to forget it as much as possible.

jvandrunen-909662 December 2019
I really like this new show. Its much better than the recent movies that have been made. The look and feel is 100% star wars and i do like the special effects, puppetry were possible, and great costumes, cgi only when needed, just like in the old days. While some people would disaggree, I do like the slow pace at which the story unfolds. Only downside is that i have to wait another week for the next episode.

This is the Star Wars you are looking for
ThreeThumbsUp30 November 2019
As an unapologetic Star Wars snob, my expectations were naturally tempered for the first ever foray into live-action television meant to venture us deep into the galaxy far, far away. I mean, I didn't want to expect too much, ya know?

Buuuuut, with the canonical show taking place in an intriguing time period never before thoroughly explored by any current Star Wars medium, I happily shelled out my 699 pennies and signed up (early on Day 1, admittedly) for the only modern platform that was going to allow me to unlock this groundbreaking program: Disney+.

After just four episodes, I simply cannot get enough.

These streaming sensations -- which we are forced to consume at a rate of 32 minutes per seven days -- feel like genuine fragments of the greater Star Wars masterpieces we have grown to cherish over the last three decades.

But even better?

Yes, quite possibly.

The Mandalorian somehow pulls off the formidable task of both providing something authentic and fresh while still maintaining the unmistakable soul of the original trilogy that spawned one of the most revered fictional franchises in modern pop-culture history.

The characters are rich and captivating in their own unique forms, often downright likable, and credibly flawed. Like all sentient beings, they are genuinely motivated, never performing nasty deeds or saving the day simply fill a shallow archetype.

Even the show's title character is the antithetical embodiment of the naive farmboy from Tatooine. He's kills for credits, appears to avoid anything but the most superficial relationships and just plain kicks ass. It doesn't take long before we are introduced to the his cadre of lethal, resourceful and potent weapons of swift-destruction. Within the first three episodes we see him vaporize a pack of Jawas, burn a Stormtrooper to a crisp, blow up half a building, snap bones, slice bodies and use various other ways to send his adversaries to sleep.

He's a hunter, an alpha riding solo in his sweet starship and someone to be feared.

But then, something happens.

I'm not here to spoil anyone's experience, because this is a piece of entertainment best enjoyed with a with a blank slate, but the Mandalorian begins to show a level of depth I did not expect. Sure, I knew they were going to have to flesh-out his character, being that he is the titular mister and all, but the undeniably dynamic Jon Favreau shows his skills from the start.

What makes this show so unique is the fact that I am exploring each episode with someone with only the slightest knowledge of any Star Wars lore and ethos. He's as enthralled as much as the hard-core fan obsessed with the overall connective tissue and "Easter eggs" of the show.

Sit back, relax and enjoy.

Fresh take on Star Wars
jamieelks25 November 2019
So far this is a really fun show that represents a part of the Star Wars universe that the audience hasn't seen before. I would definitely recommend checking this show out if you are a fan of Star Wars and want to experience another side of the universe that isn't focused on the main story line from the films.

Pretty rubbish
GazWatson13 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I'd been really looking forward to this, I'd hoped they'd put some effort into the writing. But they didn't, it was pump. An entire pointless sequence about learning to ride some beast, when he's got his own ship, he could have just flown? A bounty hunter droid that attacks a group of people, then tries to self destruct every 5 minutes? How are we to believe this droid is a hardened, seasoned, bounty hunter, if he feels the need to self destruct because some people are shooting at him? Very lazy writing, presumably the makers thought we, as an audience, would be happy with flashing lights and blasters. If it continues like this it will fail in the same way Solo failed. And they'll blame it on something other than rubbish writing, again, probably.

Underwhelming
vilkas-640179 December 2019
With recent released Star Wars films being disappointing I was not expecting much from this. But if ever a tv series could fail to make me feel any emotional perhaps other than disappointment this takes the cake. Main character has no charisma. The story line written by a child I am sure and lacks any sort of excitement whatsoever. I personally would not bother.

Not what I expected
barosanescu8 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I had high hopes for this series, however, I am very disappointed. It may be happening in a galaxy, far, far away, but some common sense should still be around. The acting is horrible, but is probably because the script is puerile. Disney is probably aiming for a children audience. For everyone that is familiar with the saga, why did they have to change things like "We do not show our face." ? And whomever is the script writer, should do some research. If you have a heat seeking scope and you can be seen daytime, you do not write lines like "We are going in at night." At night, you are even more visible. Great special effects, of course. With a budget of 100 million dollars, I was expecting a good story. Sorry, another sorry failure. At least they didn't bring Jar Jar back. I hope...

Disney continues its long reign of let-downs
olliesnape10113 December 2019
From the first 3 episodes you would be forgiven for assuming the show would involve serious themes among times of familiar Star Wars fun. But after the incredible third episode you will find yourself wishing Deborah Chow had been given the whole series to direct. Unfortunately each subsequent episode devolves into boring, often cringeworthy, divergences from an overarching journey into episode-long side plots. It is not at all helped by awful casting decisions, one-dimensional characters and of course terrible direction. Who on Earth thought it would be a good idea to let Bryce Dallas-Howard direct an episode is beyond me. Here's hoping episode 7 will bring things back on track for the last 3 episodes but after 3 awful ones in a row I am doubtful.

How Refreshing
caxton-6750324 January 2020
I am very pleasantly surprised. As many others have commented, I feel like the writers have nailed it spot on. I was 7 when I saw Star Wars in the summer of 1977, and after the film I remember asking my Dad, "Wow! Can we see that again?" And we did...again...and again. I had no expectations for The Mandalorian. Since 2012 I have been waiting for anything that made me feel like I did almost 43 years ago. This series has come closer than anything else Disney has done with the franchise to re-creating in me that almost childlike enthusiasm for the Star Wars universe.

for old fans
Kirpianuscus30 December 2019
It seems be a gift for the old fans of "Star Wars". a return to the origins, after the last films, too obvious having as target the new generations. In same measure, it is a brilliant example of the use for western recipe. And the couple of silent loner and baby Yoda works in beautiful way. The cinematography is great, the storytelling - well crafted. I admit- for me the basic source of seduction remains the presence of Wener Herzog in a role perfect for Klaus Kinski.

HONEST REVIEW
dan_o_toole30 November 2019
Ok, I was sceptical about a TV series based within the Star Wars Universe. Episode 1 has delivered a promising establishment vehicle for what follows. A somewhat nostalgic return to the aesthetic elements of the 70s/80s trilogy blended with the atmospheric style, look and mise-en-scene of Rogue One. Visual effects are very effective due to them only being used as story-telling devices and not as a gimmick to profess and justify over-inflated budgets (like the sequel movies!) Characters are solid and reminiscent of the older Star Wars world we grew up with. I even like the way they have incorporated the sound of 'ship engines' from the prequel movies BUT that's all they have incorporated from the prequels! Thank God! Especially considering that 'The Mandalorian' has so far proven to be the closest visual product comparable to the original trilogy! Are these 'one star' users completely nuts!!!!??? I guess so.. They must represent that portion of society of 'never satisfied' audiences that will always find something to moan and whine about! These people should cease to have an opinion EVER! How dare they! Anyway! back to Mandalorian.. A solid series that satisfies gradually and with consistency. I love the fact that it relies solely on telling stories and does away with contemporary social-commentary and over exaggerated political correctness that, quite frankly, has steered sequel movies to a state of disrepair!

Simply Amazing So Far!!!!!
sarahbear-6091130 November 2019
I don't have Disney+, but thanks to the internet I can watch it online for free. I've only seen three episodes, but I can already tell that it's going to be amazing!

Anyway..... at first I just figured it would be like the hidden backstory of Boba Fett, or even Jango Fett, before he got eaten by the Sarlacc in Episode VI, but it's not, it's someone else entirely. And that's definitely a good thing. I love that we get to learn more about how bounty hunters and the Mandalorians operate. I've always been curious as for why we only see Boba Fett (and, yes, I know he's not a true Mandalorian) in the movies and now we know why. And we develop a whole new perspective of them.

Typically when someone thinks "Mandalorian", they immediately think of Boba Fett, his loner personality, and his barbaric tactics, but this show gives us a new insight, as well as keeping what we know and/or feel about them. Mando, the main character, comes off as cold and heartless at times, but he's really a loyal, caring person who would risk everything for his fellow Mandalorians and the Child.

Also, as we get introduced to more characters and worlds we learn more about the franchise, which is great. "Star Wars" can be very confusing, but as things go along, it all becomes very simple. Plus, we get taken back in time to all these events, items, phrases, etc. from the original trilogy.

In short, I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially fellow "Star Wars" geeks. I have spoken.

Authentic and fresh
janistenic18 November 2019
I was sceptical and hesitant about this title but man was I blown away! After seeing last SW movie, which I walked out of in the middle after being bombarded by leftist social justice political ideology for no aparent reason, I started to slowly hate Disney and SW but the people who made this saved it for me and probably for many others, maybe generations with the things going sour in the movie franchise. First of all, the format feels and looks like is made for cinema and has a western vibe which I really like. I would describe this in two words SCI-FI WESTERN. But the feel is mild and maybe they could have made it even stronger. I can just picture in my head a young Clint Eastwood as the Mandalorian! Music is perfect, CGI is great, classic SW humor,... and every thing is made to be as realistic as it can be, so at the moment, after watching 2 episodes, I can't find any detail that would bother me. 10/10 as it stands....We just need to see how the story evelves and ties in at the end. Highly recommended....

>>Last Jedi/Force Awakens
aliabdullah-7085914 November 2019
With just a single episode out, it's hard to say whether Disney has succeeded, but one thing is clear: The Mandalorian is off to a great start, and it's perhaps the best proof yet that the Star Wars universe can lead to compelling content that isn't packaged for kids or reliant on Luke Skywalker showing up.

The first episode does a lot of heavy lifting to acclimate viewers to a part of the Star Wars universe that feels both familiar and new. There's the eponymous Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), a bounty hunter not unlike the fan-favorite Boba Fett from the films. The Mandalorian is largely a blank slate; he's mostly silent, always masked, but very good at what he does: hunting down and sometimes killing bail-jumpers and smugglers for money.

It's a toss up
DSatt5723 December 2019
Some episodes are interesting, some totally pointless and seem to be pandering to fans without moving the story along at all. It will hinge on the last episode of the season, I guess. There seems to be more money spent on effects than in storytelling or world building which is sad. But it's Disney so what was I expecting

Asandtrout17 November 2019
So, two short episodes, skeleton like, no bs, character/story centered, are better than two long episodes, crowded with characters, plot lines that eventually end nowhere and ofc the usual political allegories. Right? Right?!:D

update>ep. 4 just gave a new meaning to generic, bland, filler storytelling. Well, at least we get Gina Carano!

Lots of tropes, but little of the wit of classic Star Wars
gregravenwood17 January 2020
The plotting is simplistic, the dialog is embarrassing, the acting skills on display are modest at best. While it provides some interest with classic Star Wars iconography, the series is on par with Saturday morning live action of the 70s. I won't be surprised when the Sleestaks arrive to hiss and wave their arms at Mando, Xena Warrior Princess and Baby Yoda.

A very interesting first season - with pros and cons
tatallor20033 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
For me, this is a good show and indeed, one of the (few) good things to come out of the Disney Star Wars universe.

The Mandalorian is an enigmatic character at first - a man of few words, questionable ethics, highly skilled in combat (with some interesting combat gear by his side). So he starts out as an anti-hero. As the series goes forward, we find out that his questionable ethics are not that questionable and that he tends to do the right thing (most of the time, anyway). We find out that he is honorable and caring for other beings. And this is where baby "Yoda" comes in, which serves as his motivation throughout the 1st season.

Baby "Yoda" is indeed a lovable character, being at the center of many heart-warming moments. Unfortunately, his force-related characteristics are very questionable to me, and you'll find details related to this topic in the "cons" category below.

Besides the Mandalorian and baby "Yoda", there are several other nicely-built characters, like Kuiil (the ughnaught voiced by Nick Nolte), Greef Karga (the Guild leader played by former Apollo Creed actor Carl Weathers), and other episodic characters.

The stories are interesting and kept me connected from episode to episode. Each episode takes the Mandalorian to a place where he is presented with a near-impossible task but somehow (with the help of several friends and allies) he manages to get things done.

And thus, from an initial anti-hero, he becomes a hero (this is his character development, for those who missed it).

After this generalized review, I would also like to point out serveral specific pros and cons related to the 1st season of this show:

Pros:

1. The depicted world is definetly "Star Wars"-esqe, it takes me back to that galaxy far, far away. The world building is definetly a plus.

2. I really liked the stories - mainly, the first 6 episodes. The last 2 episodes of season 1 made less sense to me, especially the finale (details in the "Cons" list). Even so, the overall story of the 1st season is nicely planned and generally well executed (unlike the sequel trilogy...).

3. As I mentioned above, I liked (most of) the characters: Din Djarin / The Mandalorian (of course, the best one); baby "Yoda" (with the exception mentioned in the "Cons" list); Kuiil; Greef Karga; even Cara Dune (not so much in the beginning) + the episodic characters (like Peli Motto, Toro Calican, Fennec Shand, etc). No comparison stands with (most of) the characters from the sequel trilogy, for whom I couldn't care less (Finn, Poe, Rose, BB8, General Hux, Snoke as he died, Captain Phasma, Holdo, Maz Kanata, other miscellaneous characters from the Resistance, etc...).

4. The return on Tatooine :). This was one of the best things for me. I would like to mention that I found the Mandalorian's communication with the sand people of Tatooine funny and surprising at the same time.

5. Known actors part-taking in this show: Pedro Pascal, Nick Nolte, Clancy Brown.

6. The fact that this is the first Disney Star Wars production where the political agenda is tuned down to a minimum. Not all the way gone, but tuned down. It has room for improvement.

7. Last, but not least: Jon Favreau. I don't agree with all the 10 reviews here which say that he is the best, give him the reigns of the Star Wars universe - please! Let's not jump to extreme conclusions and decisions. That aside, I think that he did a great job with this series and could do more good things in the Star Wars future.

Cons:

1. One aspect of Baby "Yoda" - throughout the main series + other main canon material, there were only 2 characters from Yoda's race; both are force sensitive (what a coincidence!) and moreover, the baby seems really really powerful without any training; somehow, he realizes that he has powers and knows how to use them.

I remember that Anakin, as a kid (being the most powerful being in the Galaxy, with the largest midichlorian count ever), hadn't experienced similar behaviour until he met Qui-Gon Jin and started training. It seems that in the new "Disney" era, because things need to be bigger that in the "Lucas" era, new characters tend to skip stages and overthrow the previous characters (Anakin, for example, was built throughout 3 prequel episodes, and then rebuilt throughout 3 original episodes, chronologically speaking).

2. The 1st season finale is kind of a mess and anti-climatic, in my opinion:

a. The Mandalorian finds out (just now) about the Jedi. Really? Isn't this series supposed to take place 5 years after episode VI? Didn't the entire Galaxy know about the Jedi?

b. Moff Gideon - he seems to be introduced as the "big bad" of the series. Clearly a ruthless man - convicted for war crimes and willing to kill his own soldiers just for interrupting him. Also, indestructible for some reason: crashed in his tie-fighter, but came out without a scratch - damn, those tie-fighters seem to have really effective air-bags!

Also, seems to have some sort of magical sword (not light-saber), which, like the Ginsu knife, cuts through metal.

All of this seems a bit exaggerated to me.

c. Also, Moff Gideon and his very harmful troops (not the classic stormtroopers, which are being clearly mocked for being the worst shooters) capture the Mandalorian and co. in the client's lair and, even though they have them at their will, Gideon gives them an "ultimatum": come out until nightfall or be killed. Why...?! They were really willing to stand there with the guns pointed at the window for a few hours, even though they had the high ground...?? The Mandalorian should have just waited until nightfall, by which time all the stormtroopers' limbs would be asleep from standing in the same position for so long.

d. The Mandalorian's stubbornness (or zealotry) about taking his helmet off could have cost him his life, when a simple bacta rub saved it. So, if instead of the droid he would have had a human by his side, he would've preferred to die from septicemia instead of getting that bacta rub and miraculously become completely healthy.

All in all, I think that "The Mandalorian" is quality material and definetly worth watching.

Star Wars truly at it's best
grveliquette2 January 2020
Star Wars at it's best. The writing, directing, acting, and even the (rare) fan service bits are organic. The world of the show feels lived in and believable. This is the way... Star Wars should be.

Disney Getting It Right

Now this is pod racing.
tmac-9420714 November 2019
I've watched the first episode twice now and have to say it goes a long way to help wash away the bad taste of Disney's two sequels. Rogue One was fantastic, Solo was an ok romp but an unwanted story. I won't mention what I think of the other two, no...actually I will, they are trash. So back to this, well it was a little light on great dialogue but the components and essence of Star Wars is there. And that's the thing, the thing missing from the trash fire sequels, the essence of Star Wars. If it keeps that, which I feel it will, I can see this going on to be a brilliant and needed work in the amazing and as of now massively untapped Universe George created. So much potential in said Universe and hopefully the Mandalorian is the first of many small screen endeavours that comes along and starts to fill that potential. So yeah it's on the right track. It has the feels and seems to be the creation of people who get SW, unlike those behind the dismal sequels. I have spoken.

An interesting start, but.....
nikolai-n-grybov4 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
An interesting start, but ..... did the writer fell on his head after? 1st = good 2nd = bad 3rd = good 4th = just don't watch it ( I have so many questions to a writer about this episode...

Like: how long would it take baby Yoda to walk along side the Mandalorian from teh ship to the bar? (taking into account baby Yoda steps :) ) And it looks like 4th episode is full or similar crap and very cheap acting

I see a pattern, so maybe the 5th episode will be good.

Only 1 Ep. in so it's early but looks very promising
JamieKay54412 November 2019
Favreau and co. seem to put forth the most competent Star Wars effort by Disney thus far. While I enjoyed Rogue One and I don't hate nor do I love the flagship Disney sequels VII and VIII, this will likely be their adaptation I enjoy most. I'll be back with my reasons why at the end of the season so we shall see.

No Story.
rme-adam12 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I've watched all five episodes so far, and I can see the Star Wars fan attraction of course. But the early stuff with Carl Weathers was dreadful. He was so over the top it was embarassing. And where's the story? Because so far, it could be written on the back of a postage stamp. Mandalorian gets a mission, delivers, has a change of heart and takes baby Yoda off into space. After that, we've had nothing but rehashed cowboy stuff. I get the simple dialogue, the weaponry, the glad lack of CGI.. but unless the next episode gives us some sort of revelation I have to say.. so far, pretty poor.

Star Wars just got interesting
cafevincent12 November 2019
The Mandalorian takes Star Wars back to the more grounded samurai/western/outlaw origins, this time with a criminal protagonist. It's no Firefly but it's interesting. I must admit if this wasn't set in science fiction, I would rate this a star lower. I wish it was grittier with a TV-MA certification. I wish it had better writing and directing but hey, this is the best Star Wars you're ever gonna get so it's hard to cry about it. It's ambitious but something about the end result screams kiddie show level production value. I wanna blame George Lucas' "remember you're making this for kids" comment during his set visit, but how can I since it's born into the family genre and owned by Disney. Hopefully it's nothing that a good fanedit can't fix. I really wish they hired some better directors like Robert Rodriguez, Denis Villeneuve, Neill Blomkamp or Sam Raimi to save this show and really push the TV-14 format into excellence like Better Call Saul did. I want Mike Ehrmantraut in space!

Painting by numbers - it's what having too many fans gets you
horst6913 November 2019
This first episode was a fine example of poor film making .

Unimaginative, utterly boring, in every respect devoid of talent and even an attempt at creating a decent TV episode .

Star Wars has never been of good quality, but the indiscriminate natur of a huge fanbase has taken it from mediocre to trash .

Why try harder, when the fans will love any old crap they get served ?

A Cast of Muppets in a Generic Storyline.
rareandfirsts24 November 2019
I seem to be in a minority here, but I was disappointed with this umpteenth foray into the Star Wars universe. They took bits from virtually every SW film, put them in a blender, removed the Ewoks and added a Mini-Yoda modeled after the gremlin Mawgli and gave it a big budget.

For my taste I wish they had developed a storyline that was less juvenile and less predictable.

No Force no sabres no problem
mra-6247212 November 2019
I literally couldn't sleep last night, I was too excited for this. It's 6:30 am EST and I've already watched it twice.

The first 20 minutes I felt moved along a little fast but the episode settled into a great groove once it got going.

Cinematography, special effects and sets were 100% Star Wars but my jury is still out on the musical score.

Overall a great start especially considering the high level of expectations that come along with the first ever non-animated Star Wars TV series.

Got Disney+ for this show - cancelled subscription already
campbell_michael-4850318 November 2019
I was very interested in getting Disney+ so I could see this show and have watched the first two episodes. It started off slow and I kept watching and even watched the second episode thinking, 'it can't be this bad, it will get better..'. The CGI characters are cartoonish and look ridiculous - especially the baby Yoda-like character. I would think the show was aimed at 5 year olds if it wasn't for all of the killing (which I don't mind - I just don't get what audience this drivel is aimed at.). I had to sign up and give my first review ever. I know some direct to stream shows can be pretty bad but I had higher expectations for this as this was marketed as being a big part of the Disney+ launch. I asked my son what he though of the show (he is away at university) and he said the same thing, slow, boring and dumb cartoonish characters. Ended up cancelling Disney+.

This is Star Wars and the force has never been female...and will never be.
bravestarzole17 November 2019
What makes the Mandalorian better than anything else Disney has ever produced under the LucasFilm brand?

no forced feminism (yet)
no identity politics (yet)
no left wing agendas (yet)
no LGBTQ messages (yet)
We got character development
We got hero's journey
The protagonist is flawed much like Indiana Jones (Rey as a plain perfect character isn't relatable or believable)
The practical efects are superb, even the CGI is surprisingly good.
The theme (outer rime locations) has nothing fancy around it. Minimalist and simple just like the original trilogy.
Is it male-dominated? Well...fortunately it is, but let's be honest, how else would you imagine the life and world of a bounty hunter? You know what I mean. Yeah, it is gritty and crude and violent, has nothing feminine in it.


For god's sake The Mandalorian is the Star Wars show what we have been waiting for since 2012. Keep going that way, that's all what we want.

Started incredibly but quickly drowned and died.
drumhumper14 December 2019
The first 3 episodes are great, after that though it all goes horribly wrong. Poor acting mixed with a complete lack of story direction and all round cringeyness.

In all honesty it deserves a 6/10 But I'm trying to counter-act all the obvious Disney employees getting payed to give 10's and say it's the most amazing show in the world. Which it is not.

I don't get the hype
shahar-zivan7 December 2019
The 1st episode was promising, I'll admit that much. The 2nd was weaker, but still entertaining. By the 3rd one, the lack of character development started bothering me, but the story kept going forward at an eager pace so I was enjoying myself. The 4th episode has no character development, barely any world building and no relevance to the story. The 5th had not even one of those things. So, at this point, after 5 episodes out of a total of 8, the characters are no richer than they were at the beginning and the story has ground to a halt. What is all the hype about? Is it just because Baby Yoda is cute? I'll admit, the episodes are well made - well directed, good camera work, impressive practical effects, etc. But without good characters or a story, I don't feel anything. I really wanted to like this. I heard such good things and had such high hopes. But 5 episodes in, I am done. There are a lot of great shows out there nowadays, and I'd rather not waste my time on this one.

NOT A GREAT START
bbraddock-4989613 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
As a diehard Star Wars fan and my favorite movie of the franchise being, The Empire Strikes Back, I was super excited at the look of the previews and the tone they were setting. After watching the first episode last night, disappointed by the fact they could have delivered so much more of an opening act. I can't believe this is a 200 million dollar production. The makeup on the alien in the opening sequence was poor. The rehashed sounds, down to the exact same alien dialect in Return of the Jedi, felt like such a redundant, rehash. I do like to hear some of the same sounds effects, they bring back great memories from when I watched these films as a kid, but damn ... come up with something new. The scene where the Mando rides the, whatever the hell that thing was, is almost as bad as watching Anakin ride that, whatever the hell that thing was, in Attack of the Clones. Just cringeworthy, bad. Then, it gets good, they bring in a bad ass IG battle droid, that is just breathtaking to watch on screen. I've been waiting to see a IG droid in action since 1980, and, wait for it ... they kill off the character at the end of the damn first episode. Can somebody at Disney, or on this planet, write something better than mediocre fan fiction. It appears not.

Not what I was expecting
sonickrunch15 November 2019
I'm going to break this down by a few points:

1)The dialog is very Ep1(Phantom Menace). Comedic dialog for the sake of trying to be funny. Less realism here, more teen show. Now this is Filoni so taken as a follow up to Clone Wars/Rebels we are on point, but I think many of us expected a higher grade of realism in the tone and dialog. Ep2 of the show didn't change that.

2)Plot looks good, they added a lot of elements that can be expanded upon and I am looking forward to seeing the story unfold. I'll add though that this is from what I can tell only a short season and the 2nd episode barely added anything new, or that we couldn't have guessed from ep1's ending.

3)SFX...for $25m per episode I'm actually surprised at how many "green screen" feeling scenes there were. From the main character walking to the canteena, to the snowy storm and other CGI shots. Other shows closer to this budget have much more believability in their scenes. Usually pilots tend to be this way however this was a show that was already greenlit for a whole season so I'm not sure what happened here. Ep2 was better in this regard, however it also had far fewer environments and the ones that were used, where practical effect/on location. Outside of SFX, I found the market scene to look very average TV produced, not this big budget affair.

4)Action sequences. Going back to point 1, they are not realistic, far from what I expected, however if you expect a teen show quality or Ep1(PM), it's on point to those.

5)Throwbacks and tidbits from the canon - this is an area that I'll say shined. Lots of little details that make me know the creators and producers are aware of what they are working with.

6)Episode length. This is I think another miss. The show is basically a 30 minute show - 2nd ep is only 32 minutes. In the small number of episodes we are getting, I don't know how they will produce a "season" worth of plot, especially with ep2 being devoid of movement.

So to summarize; Don't go in expecting realistic action/dialog. Expect that the target audience is a younger target or a live action Filoni show, and you probably won't be dissapointed.

Don't understand all the 10/10s
bob_the16 November 2019
1/10 because of people review-bombing this with 10/10. Just because its nostalgic does not make it perfect.

The show has decent directing and acting, but awful writing (expected with Favreau). It is too hinged on nostalgic tropes and teasing out beloved past characters than establishing its own story. Can we just get a Star Wars film that is near the quality and uniqueness of the originals without having to resort to nostalgic copies (thanks for J.J.ing us again disney).

disappointed
jamesg1317 December 2019
Sure, the show looks cool and has a lot of fan service, yet there is no depth to the show. It's almost the end of the first season and there is no overarching plot, almost zero character development. The recipe for this show's plot is our hero receiving random jobs, from random celebrity cameos and to earn enough money to then do the same thing over and over again. There are literally endless possibilities in the star wars universe, yet in this show seems to not take any chances in expanding upon and delving into this endless universe. I still have faith in John and Dave to take some chances with this show and really give what the Star Wars universe deserves with an epic 100 million dollar live action tv series that lives up to it's name and promise.

They re-made kung-fu
smilerbaker5 December 2019
Ok, so far its a 7 but I fear it will slip, first few episodes where ok, a tad slow maybe and way too short, seriously 28 minutes!!!

I'm old enough to remember kung-fu and sorry, this is just a re-make of that and every other series of that ilk, if we take chapter 4 for instance its fallen into every single cliché going, in this vast hi tech universe full of droids and space ships everyone lives on planets resembling earth in the middle ages (just like star trek, dr who, star gate etc etc etc), the mandalorian then parks his space ship a days travel from where he's going WTF?? not too bright are you? maybe park a bit closer once in a while.

I get what they are going for, modern western / kung-fu vibe in the starwars universe but come on!! yes its kid friendly but its not the kids that pay for the subscription to disney+ is it, the writers need to up their games and quickly! needs to be a bit more bad ass and less help the villagers who only have sticks to fight with!?!??!?!

I really cannot see where they spent all the budget either, some of the sfx are pretty bad, the sets seem to be tiny and its really no better then stargate in terms of look and feel

so in summary, unless things change fast the 2nd series will be the last, baby yoda can't carry this thing for ever

Definitely the way
keoghjeff25 November 2019
I write this having watched the first three episodes three times.

Favreau has nailed what I personally love about Star Wars; the space western vibe that it seemed to have lost along the franchise.

It's about bounty hunters so that Western feel works really well with the characters and the subject matter.

If this is what we can expect from the Cassian and Kenobi (and possibly Maul) projects, the future is very promising.

Perfect in every aspect.
hurricanefelix-3053124 November 2019
Great action, great acting, great story, and a huge heart. The Mandalorian's third episode just came to Disney+ and I can say without a doubt, this is the best Star Wars has been in decades. (I'm looking at you, sequel trilogy). The Mandalorian is far and away everything a Star Wars fan needs right now. Which is actual Star Wars.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy parts of the new chapters of the Skywalker saga. But overall, these past few years, something has been...missing. I could never put my finger on it until now. The sequel trilogy gives us no reason to care or worry for these characters. With the exception of maybe Finn. Everyone else seems to have the thickest plot armor with no real consequences in their actions. And when they do, they come across as just...pointless.

You could argue that they killed off Luke and Han. Han's death, yes, that was tragic and heartbreaking. But there was the hope that Kylo would realize the mistake of his actions and turn to the light side. Which seems to imply they just did it for shock value.

Luke? Luke made absolutely no sense. His entire character changed to an unrecognizable figure with the same name, but none of the core values that made him special in the original trilogy. Luke has always been my all time favorite Star Wars character. But when he was killed off...did anyone really care?

The Mandalorian changes all of that. If you didn't notice, Chapter 2 starts...and a word isn't spoken for ten straight minutes. (I'm not kidding, go back and check.) Yet there's more spoken that words could explain.

The Mandalorian has been, so far, flawless. There is not one single thing I would change about them. It reminds me why I fell in love with Star Wars in the first place. It takes me back to when I was that little kid, playing with my brand new Star Wars figures under the Christmas tree. When I used to play with my electronic Millenium Falcon while watching the original trilogy.

Every episode I watch, I'm taken back in time. Feeling the same excitement I felt when I saw Hoth for the first time. When I saw Yoda for the first time. When I saw Obi-Wan die for the first time. When I saw Darth Vader find redemption for the first time.

The heart of Star Wars is back. And it's name is The Mandalorian.

melcraig20414 November 2019
We finally get something from Disney that isn't insulting, derivative or with an obvious agenda. But it's not great and certainly not a 9 or 10. The score is atrocious but it does feel like Star Wars just without the fun or sense of adventure. Which is a problem. I hope it gets better but I've got no faith in Disney.

Boring and lame
per-6911 December 2019
This is typical star wars in that it has some cool elements, but the lameness and stupidity drags it down.

I guess if you are 10 and still think star wars is cool this might be fun in a Disney kid-show kind a way.

Ok so maybe it's too early to judge here at least until series one is done so bear in mind this is an early review of four episodes but I'm just not 'feeling' it, at least for now.

Part of the flow seems to be in that there are short stories littered around inside of a bigger plot, and this works however as a personal preference I have never been a fan of the 'supernatural' style of series.

For those that don't know it's a style that essentially brings a conclusion to a story at the end of an episode as opposed to a built up story over time.

It for the most part feels cheap and loses my interest when a character is likely only there for the one episode then it moves on to another story as Mando moves on or a character dies. In turn I don't care to make an effort to learn a character, it feels like filler for a bigger story.

Ultimately the only real story focus at this point is baby Yoda which keeps my watching however it's a slower pace and ultimately it misses the mark to keep me captivated when broken down into lesser stories with lesser characters.

Either way, as much hype as it's getting I guess I just don't get it, I love the Star Wars universe and the style and formula is there but the soul of what makes Star Wars so great isn't. Just feels like an average spin off series. Maybe end of the season I'll feel differently, for now it's a miss.

Episode 4 (Sanctuary)
Protozoa197529 November 2019
"Since its release, Seven Samurai (...) often seen as one of the most "remade, reworked, referenced" films in cinema."

And here we go again. This is just 4th episode of the 1st season. What's with screenwriters these days? All Muses died?

Almost feels like being made by a fans with familiarity of the setting but zero sense of screen writing
xaliber1327 December 2019
The Mandalorian started out OK, but ended up as some half-baked, lazily written show that exist merely to lure parents to justify a Disney+ subscription. Kids get the usual Disney contents, moms get Baby Yoda, dads get Star Wars nerdy reference. The show almost feels like being made by a bunch of fanfiction writers with familiarity of the setting but zero sense of screen writing.

Nothing wrong with liking it, it's just the show appears to be all style and no substance.

Storyline shows no complexity at all. In fact, most of them are fillers. You can skip 4 of 8 episodes and you'll still understand the story just fine. Characters are completely uninteresting. None of them are developed. None of them had nuances: protagonists are morally good heroes; antagonists are one dimensional evils. The show relies only on a cute muppet and flashy action, but has zero substance. Had a potential great world-building with some details, but they chose to abandon it for rule of cool (and cute).

Started off with a 9/10 but goes downhill somehow
kanenasanonas7 December 2019
Let me chip in some thoughts on this:

Started off really well: good production values, great gci, no funny droids. And regarding "fan service", it is still balanced. First three episodes where top-notch, easily raking at 9/10 IMHO.

But has started to become too "rounded", too disney-like. Albait the constant killings and shootouts (yup, a way too many aliens/humans die in this one), there is no other risk. No real psychological risk, no real romance (ep 4 was the 8year olds soap opera), no serious dilemmas. Episodes 4 and 5 reminded me standalone episodes of galactica. Peripheral actors (watch ep 5) act like 80s characters also.

I'm still waiting to see where this is going, and I'm not talking about the baby arc, I'm talking about getting serious for once.

Meh
deepc-188-2062041 December 2019
This isn't a bad show but it certainly isn't a great one. I'd go as far as to say it's boring. I suspect I'm in the minority but The Mandalorian just doesn't do it for me. The title character is like a robot and not in a good way. I don't blame Pedro Pascal - he is a great actor who I've enjoyed watching in GoT, Narcos and Triple Frontier. He's been given a tough assignment to star in a show where you never see his face (or not in the first four episodes at least) and it's just not working for me. It is possible to have engaging characters like this and we have to look no further than the Star Wars franchise itself with Darth Vader and Boba Fett but they could just as well put up a cardboard cutout of the Mandalorian on the screen for all the charisma he displays. Another problem for me is the writing. It seems a little aimless. I guess the main thread is the parallel between the Mandalorian's childhood and what Yoda-baby is going through but I just can't get invested. The sets and special effects are good. Some of the supporting cast do a decent job. Werner Herzog plays his role well and Carl Weathers is OK. Gina Carano on the other hand ain't the best actor in my book. Storm-troopers still can't shoot to save themselves in this series. It would be nice if they were actually made a threat. One good thing about this series is that if there is a political message in there I can't see it. Thanks to Jon F. for creating a TV show that is just entertainment and not pretentious preaching. I wonder if this is the real reason there are so many positive reviews? I'll probably end up finishing the series but only because I've got this far.

Nothing but fan service
reklamok7 December 2019
Unbelievable how people give 10 points to this. There is no story only fan service.

Everyone loves baby yoda, but no one knows Star Wars. Baby Yoda just erased everything that was in Star Wars I-VI, because Star Wars I-VI was about Anakin restoring the balance to the Force by destroying both the Jedi and the Sith.

Now Disney's non-creative team decided it wasn't. Everyone thought the strongest Force user was Anakin, as he was created by the Force. But NO! The strongest Force user is this baby! It can stop and levitate a charging giant rhino, while Luke was not able to stop and levitate the Rancor, and neither was Obi-wan or Anakin able to stop those charging monsters in Attack of the Clones. Baby Yoda is stronger then them. And it is 50 years old so it was alive while the Jedi were the guardians of the Galaxy, and were finding Force sensitive creatures all over the place. Somehow they could not find the strongest on the planet where Yoda was from. Hey, maybe the Jedi were blind. But Palpatine was able to sense Luke, while he wasn't strong at all, yet did not sense this thing who is proven to be much stronger? For no good reason non of them knew about this thing, who is stronger with the Force then Luke, Obi-wan and Anakin was?

I don't understand the hype
gracewalliss20 November 2019
After seeing/reading all the reviews online highly praising The Mandalorian I decided to give it a go - big mistake. It's boooooring! Nothing exciting happens throughout episode 1 and even episode 2. The main character is hidden behind a mask for all of ep 1 & 2. I found it very hard to connect with him. What did he look like? How was he feeling? Asides from the casual head movement and whispered dialogue he didn't do anything. We don't even know his name! The episodes drag out far too long. They could be 20 minutes and still be too long. There's a lot of walking and not much talking.

Only 1 episode
ajviele13 November 2019
The 1st episode was so uneven I don't know where to start. It looks great at moments, but at others terrible camera angles and poor cgi. The music is like out of a free video editor you get on CNET, I am baffled by this. Hire a composer this is SW not some Netflix made for tv mo series. The pace is right, the main character is like a soy tough guy. The action was dull and boring. Let's see how it plays out.

Started great, got boring very soon
rme-adam23 December 2019
The first episode (and maybe the second) were great.. the rest of this could be written on a postage stamp. There is no plot, no story, no *development*. All we're given are a series of utterly predictable outcomes. If this wasn't Star Wars-related, I'm pretty sure it'd get a very boring and big hands down, because that's all it would deserve.

Put star wars in the name and they will love any crap
joaosantos203 January 2020
It is boring, looks weird for 2019, story is stupid and non existent, characters are bland especially the mandalorian, was the charisma of a rock. And then there's baby Yoda, the equivalent of a cat YouTube video, a like catch machine. Star wars died after the 3 original movies, now is just a money machine.

I just don't get the hype
The1whoknocks12 December 2019
This series is carried by its cinematography, a certain creature and its music because the plot sure doesn't bring much to the table. There are no stakes and the whole story is very predictable. I was hoping for a show with the gritty feeling of Rogue One but I guess it has to remain family friendly to keep the audience as wide as possible.

I get so sick of these shows that there are only 2 watchable episodes. The first and the last. Game of thrones was bad about that in the last couple seasons. I hope this show doesnt make it a habit.

Claiming it as average is overrating the pilot.
iavorst13 November 2019
Obviously the Star Wars franchise has a massive fan base. This is the only reason the pilot has been saved from devastating ratings and reviews. It lacks all kinds of substance and a hook. Just a semi-pretty picture of 40 minutes that leaves you wondering if anything at all happened?

Surprisingly bad
arielag22 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I'm super surprised about so many 10/10 scores. Do we even watch the same show?After two episodes - it is really boring and extremely childish. Main character is a wuss. The egg challenge - it was silly - he kill creature who lies eggs to get one. Jawas should be upset because there will be no eggs anymore. And he managed to do that only with the help. He was ready to give up! But he is also a MacGyver - he managed to put together a spaceship (airtight) in one day.And of course no blood, lots of shooting but no strategy or special abilities (flamethrower came up useless), no special tactics. An also it is very convenient that bad guys wears trackers so anybody with proper receiver can find them in one day. It is so many simple and bad ideas that is very difficult to watch this show. For me massive disappointment. Surprisingly bad

The Best Star Wars Since Return of The Jedi!
crowes-1886528 December 2019
Apparently what the Star Wars universe needed was a step back from the grandiose ultimate good vs. ultimate evil, galaxy at stake struggle between Sith and Jedi. What makes this show so good is its willingness to stay small and explore the seedy underbellies of the Star Wars universe and show us how the fall of the Empire impacted the working class and average citizens of various planets. Favreau has managed to both take us back to the feel and magic of the Episodes 4 - 6 while giving us something wholly new and exploring a time period we have not been shown before. He has never disrespected the source material of any project he has worked on and this is a shining example of that. You feel for these characters, worry for them and feel real emotion over their ultimate fate which is something blatantly missing from The Rise of Skywalker. There is one scene in the finale which evoked more emotion than did the entire running time of TROS. There was and still is a magic when watching Episodes 4 - 6 and The Mandalorian has given us a taste of that magic which has been missing for so many years. You know you've got something good when the audience cares more about the droids on the tv show than the living characters in the latest movie!

This is a Star Wars we deserve and want!
pontifex-0657328 November 2019
Wow, just wow. After I have lost hope for movies because of constant pushing of political narratives here commes something really great and restores my faith. The Mandalorian is a story written so good it chains you to the screen. You get sucked into dark, troubling and hard world of a merc that has a painful story behind him but also a somehow good heart. The character was so well writen that I'm amazed. He has flawes, weaknesses and sometimes even looses battles only to solve a problem on a different way. He is not a regular Marry Sue character that can beat 100 guys on his own, sometimes he has to run, sneak and retreat. I hope this series will get at least 10 seasons because I would like to follow Mando's strougle trough entire universe since I can relate so much with him and because this is the only series that is worth watching and is not infected by SJW leftist political agendas and constant pushing of narratives. I hope writes and all people who are contributing to this show stay the same and don't bend to pressure from people that wants to destroy everything good just so that they can brainwash people. Mando is best thing that happened to Star Wars and to movie making scene in last 10 years. I can't wait to watch the next episode because it got me hooked up.

ed-503-46518328 November 2019
I really hope they don't flip this on us. But as of the 3rd episode this is good old fashion Star Wars. No social justice warrior themes no intersectional feminism, no anti-patriarchy, or check your white male privilege at the door. ....just Star Wars.

I hope they keep it up. As long as they do I'll stay subscribed.

BRAVO FAVREAU. YOU ROCK. THANK YOU.
ScoobySnacks6627 November 2019
There are many other excellent reviews for this stunning new Star Wars series that explain why this is the must watch show on Disney's new streaming service. And while I hate giving the mouse company even more of my hard earned money (I mean seriously folks, they own everything) I feel the need to chime in and thank Jon Favreau for single-handedly saving the Star Wars franchise. With Favreau's insightful and careful direction, this team has created a Mandalorian series that is beautiful, nostalgic, serious when it needs to be, well acted, intriguing, heart warming, tastefully humorous (no one has drank blue milk from the teat of an alien walrus yet) and true to what made the 1977 original such a spectacular, life-changing film. I can't say anything bad about this series (mind you it's only at episode 3, so don't mess it up guys!) except that I wish the episodes were a little bit longer.

This is good stuff. This is also proof that Disney doesn't necessarily have to screw up Star Wars. They are capable of producing what the fans are craving for. I hope that Disney will learn from this in all future Star Wars endeavors. Finally a big thank you to Jon favreau, I hope this is just the beginning of his involvement with Star Wars.

Star Wars in every second
steventot24 November 2019
Just finished episode 3 and I must say, this is fantastic! Absolutely amazing "real" Star Wars! All episodes represent something from the original star wars saga, you will feel nostalgic, also very refreshing jokes and funny moments paced at the right time, Favreau is the master of setting the mood for every scene. Acting is also on point! This is better than I was hoping for, fantastic show even for non star wars fans. I am loving it and hope it stays at same production quality levels through the seasons! For me, series of the 2019...

A New Hope for Star Wars
jedifrey24 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I was just two years old in 1977 and from the moment that Star Destroyer filled the movie screen I was hooked. You might say we grew up together and for over forty years now, Star Wars has been my faithful companion. For a long time, all I had were the toys and movies, but then we started getting new stories in the form of comics and books. There were some really good stories, and some not so good stories, but I took anything I could get. The authors were fairly meticulous keeping the storyline on track. There were only a couple of individual stories that didn't fit in.

Twenty years later, they re-released the original trilogy with new and altered scenes. At first I was excited, but then I saw them. Some of the changes were visually stunning, like the hallways in Cloud City. Other changes were unnecessary. I'm sorry, but Han shot first.

We got the prequels, and they were pretty good, but even as I watch them over today I'm left feeling like Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side and murdered everyone he ever knew over a couple of bad dreams.

Fast forward and we get some sequel movies that George originally planned, then denied, then sold, and then Disney said they would do them. Wow, we were going to get to see our heroes on the big screen again, but we were told to forget everything we knew about them, because all that had happened for the last forty years hadn't really happened. Harrison Ford wanted out, so Han was killed by his new son. Luke turned into a washed up, have crazy hermit with suicidal thoughts living in utter seclusion and when the Galaxy needed him the most, he just died for no reason. So far, I don't have a lot of hope for Rise of Skywalker.

But there is a New Hope. The Mandalorian is everything that Star Wars should be. Excellent storytelling. Awesome effects. A baby Yoda. This is the future of Star Wars. All should be turned over to Jon Favreau and Dave's Filoni!!!

A new hope for Star Wars franchise
budekman23 November 2019
This show is a new hope for Star Wars, very high quality and performance, it give in depth with the Star Wars universe history and the culture, it's encourage you to find out more about the Star Wars saga, the story is very strong with this one, the moral decision and, the plot are very thick and addicting to watch more. the action and shooting ? well they really get my adrenaline. the soundtrack ? you need to give it an applause for the orchestra team. everything in this show is excellent, except it's very short, 30 minutes for 1 show. I recommended for old star wars fans and new to watch this show, there I have spoken.

After three episodes I'm stunned. All that I wished for came through. It's fun but not too fun, There's action but it's low key and serious, the music score is fantastic and I love that Mando keeps his helmet on (seriously, the removal of the helmet destroyed all fears of Kylo Ren). Each episode slowly builds up to a crescendo without going too far. Well done and may the force be with Jon Favreau!

Incredible Star Wars Vibe!
hmfrosado22 November 2019
This is Star Wars. From the acting to the editing. Bringing some legends from the originals was incredible and made me think that now Disney is on the right track. If my generation vibe'd with the originals, this younger generation will do it again ! Pascal is doing a great job. Even not being explicit, the acting is incredible and so intense. Thank you to make me re-vibe! And yes, the bounty hunter droid was incredible, this is not a spoiler, is more a motivation for people to watch the series.

Good start...
guardmcc17 November 2019
Edit. Added a star. This really is a lot of fun. 3 episodes in.

It's decent. I'm going to hang around and see if it avoids the mess that the latest trilogy has become. Favreau and Filoni are good signs; They have a good track record with SW.

1 star deduction for the music. It's not bad, actually quite good, but doesn't seem to have any relation to any SW music ever. Mild mood killer. 1 star deduction for the scripting. Pascal's lines are a bit childish. Not his fault but possibly better to have him say nothing. 1 star deduction for a mild lack of creativity. To rope in fans you'll need to give them something mildly familiar. While there is a bit of that, something that evokes deep memories would be good. As an example; the Mandalorian's ship is uninspiring. How about a CEC YT-1200, the model before the Falcon? Evoking memories of quite possibly the most famous fictional spacecraft in cinema history, while not actually being it. Just a thought.

BLUF: fun, but will need to up its game to draw back disgruntled fans driven away by the most recent SW offerings. Decent start. Hoping improvements come.

Netflix sci-fi vibes
Scarn_Michael17 December 2019
I was very excited about this series but I'm very disappointed in what it turned out to be.

Let's start from the good things. It feels like the first Star Wars films, no doubt. The characters behave similarly, and the setting as well as the general rhythm are on point. If it weren't for the incredible CGI, one could say it was made in the 80s. This is also a problem, since it makes every episode extremely slow, and sometimes a bit boring. I have the feeling that some scenes might as well have been cut, and nothing would have been lost. Actually, entire episodes could have been left out completely, since nothing really happens. Mando travels from place to place every episode, encountering new characters that disappear after the end of the (short) episode. They look like parentheses in the plot, with the exception that so far it's all there is. What is the story exactly? To be fair the bits of plot there are make sense, sometimes. But mostly the characters make very weird choices, and sometimes it feels as if they were forced by the writers. Mando himself is not a very clever character, and the fact that we cannot see his face makes him less of an interesting one.

Overall it reminds me of some sci-fi Netflix series I have watched and can't remember of. Because it was unremarkable.

*I have watched up until episode 6

Show is slipping every episode.
stbrads-932-48576815 December 2019
Started off ok, every episode I like it less. I get we don't want a Gary Stu here, but seriously, the Mandalorian is constantly getting beat down and his weapons and ship suck. Supposed to be a legend, not seeing it anywhere. He's weak and gets lucky more than anything. The Guild backstory is weak, character development is seriously lacking. Disney is way over playing the cute Yoda card.

The episodes are coming off like bad parodies. Episode 4 is like a bad Avatar, or dancing with Wolves. Episode 5 is like a discount suicide squad. The acting in this episode is terrible.

This show is just bad.
chris-86-11477312 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
There is no reason to watch this show unless you're a huge Star Wars fan. That fans find it better than the Star Wars movies is not exactly a huge compliment.

There is virtually no story here through five episodes. It looks cool and the action is good, particularly the battle in the pilot with the Bounty Droid. The acting and writing are corny as hell, even for Star Wars.

This show falls victim to what's become epidemic in the 'content age' - there is roughly 90 minutes of interesting story, action, and conflict here and instead of 90 minutes we get 3-4x that because it has to be a 'series'.

So how do you create and extra three and a half hours? Well, stuff it full of irrelevant story lines *SPOILERS*



The young bounty hunter chasing down the big bounty in the desert only to betray the Mandalorian was irrelevant. It was motivated by Mando's need to fix his ship after it was damaged in a space battle that literally came from nothing. The episode started in a space battle. What?

These massive companies predict that their IP (Star Wars, marvel, etc) is so strong and that their audiences are so undiscerning that they can just pass this stuff off as quality, and it turns out they're right, sadly.

Getting there
Sir Gerry13 November 2019
Judging by all the 10's here, we can say that we SW fans are easy to please, then why did it take them so long? Although this first episode seems like a step in the right direction, let's not get carried away. To me at least, this is not a 10, that score is reserved for Empire. But this certainly feels a lot like Star Wars, mainly because it's set very close to RoTJ, so we get to see Stormtroopers, Ughnaughts, Gonk Droids and listen to Huttese being spoken. The first episode tells us a little bit about The Mandalorian, a very classic anti-hero. The action is very good and the cinematography is quite good too, even though I don't like that degraded palette so in vogue today. Sadly the soty was kinda predictable, sometimes it felt as a youtube fan movie (a very good one though) The music was very odd, but somehow fits into the overall theme. To me, this show has given me hope that the Obi Wan series will be amazing!

Naive and Lame
thiagodcano28 December 2019
Positive points: baby yoda

And that is it. The script is so naive, everything is so shallow. I just couldn't bare to watch a episode with making at least 3 pauses to convince myself to get to the end.

Dumb but not dumb fun
mformoviesandmore22 November 2019
Perhaps it was made for children's hour.

It is a very cheesy take on old cowboy movies, which has some relevancy as Star Trek TOS was meant to be a cowboy in space.

I tried to find something to enjoy but puberty was just too long ago.

Not great, not terrible
ahabkapitany16 November 2019
Condiserably better then Disney's frustratingly lackluster moneygrabbing attempts so far, yet still lags behind the multitude of well written, well executed shows of recent years (Chernobyl, The Terror S1, Fargo S1, etc).

This series shows how easy it could have been to avoid the disaster new Start Wars turned out to be. All this show does is present a nice production design with a relatively unimaginative writing and OK direction, and yet everyone seems to love it because Star Wars.

Overall, this show is a huge step in the right direction. Stellar even, compared to recent Star Wars. Average and a little cliche on it's own merit.

Waste of time.. Better tv shows out there
sahanaj-1603622 November 2019
First of all let me just say, how did this get a 9.1. It baffles me because this show should be rated a maximum of 5.

I have given this a 1 because it lacks what Star Wars is. Basically the characters are boring, it drags on way too much, 30 minutes is way too short and seems to rely on nostalgia. Not forgetting the cheesy, stilted dialogue and horrible CGI. This looks like another case of Disneyfying Star Wars.

Ultimately let me just say. Forget about watching this, there are far more superior tv shows on the market with an abundance in genre that don't screw over the audience and rely on hype bs.

Fun to watch but absolutely horrendous from a technical standpoint
cdean-8770024 December 2019
I want to start off by saying I'm loving watching the show for a reason I can't understand. The show seems to avoid being good, but for every time it starts to develop character or plot it seems to undo its self. After 6 episodes there have been only three significant events. As much as everyone says it is it is not star wars either, Star Wars has always been covered in symbolism and hidden messages and meanings for things but none of that has happened on a significant scale. As much as I enjoy this show I can't give it more than 3 stars

Visually stunning, poorly scripted
orbisluminosa13 December 2019
As a star wars fan, I had big expectations with this new live action serie. But after watching it completely I feel a bit disappointed. The visuals of sceneries, characters and everything related to the SW universe was okey, but the story felt somehow poor and sloopy, for a moment I felt I was watching a 5 years old children's show. The first 3 episodes were quite interesting but then it started everything to go downhill. I really hope they could do beter for season 2.

Inconsistent and brain numbing kids show, but still decent watch. Is that the way?
abyssone1 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
CGI, atmosphere, settings all is very star wars and nicely made. But some things are totally brain numbing. Killed that big animal with small knife instantly. Took so many hits from it. Deciding to save child 0 0 , everyone helping him? This is the way? Its kids show, thats all. Inconsistent and brain numbing.

Great so far
kiralynnpd13 November 2019
Even though I am writing this with only one episode is out, Mandalorian is one of the greatest Star Wars shows I have watch. I love our protagonist so far and want to know so much more about him and the other characters! The cinematography is great and the score so far is epic (probably cause it's composed by the same guy who did the score for Black Panther). Overall, good show so far and can't wait for more episodes!

Belongs in a Trash Compactor on the Detention Level
play_burnman13 November 2019
This was so bad I don't even want to spend the time reviewing it, but I must.

From the get go it was pure tropes and lame humor, with an extra helping of fan service. Now, I don't really mind the fan service but it was very heavy handed and seemed to take precedent over things like the plot making sense. The character waffles between certifiable bad a-- to bumbling idiot depending on what the writing needed. It felt a strange combination of shallow, forced, and rushed (plot wise). Practically every scene had some moment that made no sense if you even remotely reflected on it.

It was very pretty. If you are the type of person who can turn off your brain, drop your expectations to nil, and feast on eye candy, then this is for you.

If you were hoping for Star Wars to redeem itself and finally do something worthy of the title, well keep waiting.

But hey, who knows? Clone Wars didn't get off to an amazing start but it sure ended there.

A good Rebels episode
fredericofb12 November 2019
It was a nice first episode but too fast paced and only 36 minute long so it felt a little like a rebels episode. No time for character or location development. Watch force awakens for that 30 minute long of Rey's life. That's storytelling 101. It felt a bit too fan film and too much western but that's the aim of the show right?

Better than other Star Wars junk of late, but not a 9/10. Too many kid reviews I guess.
jewboyplaya14 November 2019
Better story telling more in line with traditional Star Wars, however it still suffers from Disney-esque over-produced effects and suspension of belief in action sequences. Obviously it received a deluge of unwarranted 10/10 ratings...I would rate it a 7.5, but I rounded down to 7 to offset the ridiculous 10/10 ratings.

It's star wars and that says it all
mahirhrnjic-209769 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Looking at all the reviews I have the feeling watching something different. I can't see how you rate the show so high, there is really nothing special about it. If you keep out the star wars theme everyone would say it's crap, but just being star wars doesnt make it perfect by default. At chapter 5 now and still no clue where they are heading to, every chapter same story. Landing on a planet, mostly unplanned, heading to a bar (why as hé can't drink in public!!!), get a fob, catch a bad guy and earn money. There is literally no main story so far!!!! Tempo is way too low, in this pace they can make 3000 chapters.

Its starwars but not as you know it?
nikashcroft12 November 2019
Ok I'm disappointed. I had high Hope's for this series after what appeared to be strong trailers. I'm a HUGH starwars fan. Born in 72 I grew up on the movies. The force awakens was ok? I got the need for a reboot for a younger generation. Dont get me started on the last jedi! In simple terms a betrayal of the story to date. Yet that aside I loved rogue one and enjoyed Solo. So with high Hope's I sat tonight to absorb the Manadalorian. Firstly production value. Well it's not movie quality. It looks like what it is, a TV show. Second the sound score. Well it ain't John Wiliams! No nods to the original theme. The acting is ok but feels scripted. Like starwars meets coronation street. Nice to see an R2 unit driving a speeder and other little nods to the source material but it didnt feel right to me. Last ten minutes vastly improved and the big reveal in the last minute is quite cool. Ok the stage is set. I can only hope starwars enters stage left in episode 2.

Garbage
marcus-chugh23 November 2019
In the first 3 minutes, we saw an American English speaking blue "alien" that sounds like Horatio Sans which ruins the vibe. Then, the Mandalorian proceeds to kill a bunch of people for now apparent reason. He was sitting at the bar with his helmet on with no apparent method to eat or drink. Then he meets a guy outside in the winter who hails cabs, but no real reason he should be outside, except he plays a flute for some reason. Then the Mandalorian sends away the modern landspeeder in favor of an older one that backfires- for no reason. Then they travel through the winter air, but there is no cover or shield for the landspeeder, for some reason.

I had to turn off this drivel- I loved the original movies but this is almost as bad as Episodes 1-3.

Story-Telling as Sharp as the Mando's Shooting
wisemantonofski5 January 2020
A perfect blend of what we know about Star Wars and what we've never seen, Mandalorian takes the gritty and dirty tone that worked so well in Rogue One and dials it up in a way that calls back so beautifully to classic Western serials of the 1930s. Dialogue is cut down to the bare essentials, leaving only the remarkable expressionality of that gaunt T-shaped visor in its place and yet, we feel the Mando's conflict as we felt Vader's in the original trilogy, through an exceptional physical performance unrivaled in modern story-telling; and while the episodic nature of its tragically short stories can frustrate the impatient, the building blocks of character and consequence line up almost unseen to build a tense finale that exceeds all expectations.

What Star Wars is meant to be not the Disney hack job of a trilogy .
shaunh-1175214 December 2019
Each episode has felt as though you are truly taken into the Star Wars universe, the series is made by fans for fans and so has done a great job of leaving the political correctness out that ahas plagued the Disney trilogy, if they keep it up it will stay a fan favourite.

Would have been a 10 if it wasnt for the 4th episode.
rubenkuiper-4555030 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This truly is an amazing show. It really awakens them Star Wars fibes, and the show grabs a hold of you very fast. The first 3 episodes were truly amazing, but episode 4 really ruined the show for me. The dessert scene did me very good, i think that leaving it behind wasn't a good move. Then this muscled girl that can't act joins the team, and the way she is introduced feels very forced. She didn't contribute to anything to the show, no character development, no nothin. Also, this asian widow, a pretty decent actor, falls in love with Mando in like a week, without really knowing him or even seeing his face. This feels very unreal. This was one of those filthy filler episodes. First 3 episode where awesome, this one totally wasn't. Hopefully episode 5 gets the series back in track, because episode 4 got the series very far from this track.

Poor acting, poor CGI, poor storyline, and an over all poor bounty hunter. (Allows prisoner to access his weapons cabinet.

OMG this was terrible..
MovieCriticOnline14 November 2019
The casting, the acting, the story (lame and predictable). I can point to 50% of it being totally ripped from New Hope. Do any of these people ever bother to watch the original Star Wars that had the MAGIC that everyone loved?

What a shame because it looked good. Just annoying characters and the guy playing bounty hunter was awful. The voice was horrible and he came off as a whiny girl.

The writing is just so bad. The dialogue doesn't resemble anything original Star Wars. It's a bad made-for-TV-movie written by people that never saw Star Wars before. Phrases like "what the hell?" The fun about the original star wars wad the new and foreign language. Typical scene from the Mandalorian. Bounty hunter walks into a bar. See a mysterious woman, follows her, she attacks him, no reason (and basically kicks his behind, i still have no idea how that was real), then in the middle of fighting he asked her if she wants some broth, cut to them chatting in the bar. Who writes this crap?

They wasted all the nice effects, costumes, landscapes etc.

Baby Yoda looks like a Gizmo and not in a good way.

Is this bounty hunter not supposed to know about Jedis even though it's been around the galaxy and well known for 1000s of years. And though the original Star Wars films CLEARLY showed you that it is a LEARNED skill you shape with practice through the way of the Jedi, here baby Yoda uses the force without any training. They never thought this through.

Skip it!

Nothing special at all
decoyo14 November 2019
Disney are just not able to release a good Star Wars product. The last Jedi was a disaster and they may have learned something from it. Here we see some references to the original movies (a desperate try to bring the old fans back?) but still nothing original or interesting. This TV shows is probably better than the rest, but to be part of the Star Wars family, means to be special. For now there is nothing special, lets hope there will be an improvement.

comaduster13 December 2019
My first problem, wheres the story? Seriously, the first two episode are fantastic, and after, only filler episodes.

The second, the music. THE music. It would throw a lot of mood into it if there was real Star Wars music, because now its only some professional cosplay show, with some ambient sounding for me.

For season two, it will be very, very little.

Way too high rated..
Legbreaker13 December 2019
I am a big 'starwars universe' fan, and love most of the movies around this starwars core.. but Mandalorian is in my opinion not that good as many claimed. Episodes are too quick and simple plotted and far from intelligent. Special effects like the space combat in episode 4 or 5, cant quite remember, are foolish and el cheapo. As said earlier, the episodes are way too easy.. It's just high rated because of Starwars fans shooting out stars.

So boring and the film music is destroying everything
pufflingpants12 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
"This is the way". Well, it's not. The painfully repeated stupid greeting I guess should be somehow taken as brave, powerful, noble, manly. It's ridiculous and bores me to death like the action and fighting scenes in the first two episodes. Especially the music during the action scenes is dull (like 80ies compter game music), not at all powerful and so weakens the scenes further. There's not much of a story, really, and that's the problem. Bounty hunter kills people or beasts and rescues this super cute looking baby-yoda-like creature and takes it with him. So the baby is with him while he again kills people and beasts. He himself is now a target because he has the baby. That's it. They try to put in humor, that doesn't work and the little side stories are all taken out of the big sci-fi cauldron. Seen it all before a lot of times. The production looks cheap like early star trek settings (where it ist actually ok). I guess WErner Herzog must be very disappointed with this end product. The cooing baby-creature is sweet though for a while, but just for a while. It's not enough.

Story ?
heinde-588-6561989 December 2019
After the other comments I just want to add : As a big Starwars plan since childhood and having read so many Starwars books I cannot understand they write a new story which is clearly for 5 year olds . After the 3rd episode there is no continuity to the story , it's boring , the lines are poor , no ingenuity nor fantasy.

Why don't they buy the story of an already successful Starwars book writer ? The thrawn trilogy would be my first choice

The only good thing is the effects are lucasfilm worthy but It seems they don't want to spend money on anything else

Heres to 7 year old me!!
alaskasteelernation12 November 2019
I wish i could go back in time to 1980 and bring this to 7 year old me the first time i seen Boba Fett in Empire. I would have died right there in Fairbanks Alaska at the Goldstream Theatres . Did not really enjoy The Last Jedi and Skywalker movies but liked them because they were Star Wars. Mandalorian is basically a great Dark 50s Western with Droids..which is beautiful. Jon Favreau is truley a fan and it shows with every background nod to geeky fandom. Really great use of the vast amount of races throughout the Star Wars Universe. The 80s cartoon Droids was kinda silly but Mandalorian takes that corner of the Universe and really uses it well. Dark dusty and dangerous..no lines of Empire or Rebels...just a very grey Wild West atmosphere. I think people that dont even like Star Wars but love great Westerns like The Good,The Bad and The Ugly would enjoy The Mandalorian . I am very excited that i really enjoy this and get to look forward to weekly episodes. Whatever day this show lands on will quickly become my favorite day of the week. To 7 year old Ray..Cheers!!! :-)

A Rough Draft of an Uninspired Series on All Accounts
brentonwiseman14 November 2019
I saw a review that said "if you liked Rogue One, you'll love this", and I completely agree. If you're watching a show/movie and just want to see and hear things you recognize and don't care about the quality of the writing, editing, score, and effects, you'll have a great time.

My main problems with the show (so far...) isn't the quality of these piece, but the fact that they don't go together. The music is loud and off-putting, trying to make a boring scene of mounting an ugly animal or making a piece of armor seem much more entertaining than it actually is. The writing is eye rolling and seemingly rushed, with both the story and dialogue. The only consistent part of the episode is how quickly everything moves, going from one thing to the next, without any regard to the pacing and whether or not the audience cares about what's happening yet.

I went in to this show hoping that the creators would have the freedom to do something great, especially after the ratings I saw. But it seems that it was just Star Wars hype once again, and the creators were either not giving the freedom they needed, or they were not giving the criticism that was needed that would've helped improve this. I'm not here to disagree with a bunch of people, but to look after the people like me that were (very) hungry and hoping for some good Star Wars these days. Not worth your time.

P.S. don't start your first episode with your most annoying and out of place characters

Just no...
jochemunlimited13 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I wanted to wait till the end of the season, but I have already made up my mind: I do not like the show. I am wondering what I am watching, it is maybe a real life version of Star Wars rebels? Short episodes, every episode a new adventure, a slow progressing back story.

But why do I like that show more? And yes you must not compare things, but I feel nothing with the Mandalorian. I understand he cannot take of his helmet in public, but why not show his face to us viewers? I just see an action figure walking and jumping around, like a puppet. He is looking silly to me compared to his environment. And people in the show can see the emotion on his face I think. But how?

The episodes are short, that should not be a problem. But now I feel like you just jump in somewhere without much context. And yes they will give you hints about the Mandalorian, but there is not much development. Everybody knows him except us the viewer.

So I feel not attached to this person. He is a no nonsense bad-ass with honor or something? Or he is someone with feelings and doing the right thing and no upbringing skills? Just leave a child in the closet or to another strange person? Or must I as a viewer think now: no wonder because he only knows killing!

I almost never feel like: oh this is tensive or I must think here. It is just a tiresome show. Sometimes you think: why is he donig that? And you also think: why is this happening? Yes there is action, but there are things happening and you suddenly go to the next scene. And there or some scenes alter everything is finished and solved. But how? Why?

Also the acting is a bit off for me. I do not know how to call it: is it overacting or B-class acting. It is not real life (yes I know Star Wars is not real... :P). Is it a comedy action show? Is it for kids or for young adults?

I also do not feel it is Star Wars. Yes it looks like Star Wars, but everything is in between. Not bad, not good, just colourless. It has no soul. Maybe it is a generation thing, I also do not like the new movies. I like the books, I like the old movies and also the movies after that. I like most of the cartoon shows. So what am I missing? I am really trying to like it, but sorry... Maybe season 2 if they improve some things. Maybe it must grow.

But I do not want to wait for the other episodes, maybe the first and the last episode are the best, I do not know. Everything between must also be of high quality, especially when you have short episodes like this. So for me, I want longer episodes, more context, more depth to the characters, to the worlds, more various action, more thinking.

Nostalgic Ratings
Yahya_Adada13 December 2019
The show weighed too much on the legend and artifacts of Star Wars without any effort for writing a proper script and a decent plot for the series. Without Star Wars gadgets the show deserves 1/10. If it wasn't for baby Yoda, I wouldn't bother to keep up.The high ratings are from blindfold loyal fans.

Stale and Predictable
peterdcoombs22 December 2019
This was a great opportunity to add some much needed texture and creative thinking to the Star Wars universe which has told simple stories of good guys vs. bad guys for 9 movies now and in my opinion is crying out for mature, more layered characters and plot lines . I was hoping for something more like what Marvel did with the Daredevil series or the movie Logan or what DC did with Joker . But this is still strictly kids/spaghetti western stuff recycled for space. The bad guys are ugly and laugh every time the do something bad. They are terrible marksmen and nobody knows why they are just so darned mean. The good guy is a bit mysterious, troubled and conflicted but underneath it all he has a heart of gold and will always do the right thing. Plus of course he ALWAYS hits his target. Seen it a million times already. The 3 stars are because it looks OK and fanboys & girls will of course love it anyway.

Keira_R26 November 2019
I watched the first SW movie in the theater, I'm old, I've seen it all before. When you have seen everything before something has to be really good an inventive to even have me watch three episodes. This is not it. It looks good and it has a little char in it that probably will make you go "oooh, is that HIM?" But besides that it's a video game with video game moves done by a video game character. Maybe it's all setup for now but I'm not waiting anymore. Sorry but, just because it's SW and it looks good it doesn't mean it IS good. It is kind of boring so far actually. Oh another story like that, oh another char like that... yawn, snore, huh what? Is he going to make the jump? Is he going to win that fight? Sure he is, because he has a companion that is probably more awesome and powerful than the main character..., yeah.. what!? I seriously feel like watching a let's play on Youtube really...

Disappointingly simple. Slow, childish, not much happens throughout the series.
gaelankirby13 January 2020
I really looked forward to the Mandalorian. I enjoyed the first two episodes, but quickly realized that the plot evolves at a painfully slow pace. The show's dialogue is very simple and minimal.

He rescues baby Yoda and continues planet hopping while running away from bad guys for three or four episodes. It is not surprising what happens. The side characters are mostly pathetic and comically stupid.

Baby Yoda is a cute bundle of joy though. I always enjoy seeing him do his thing. Other than that, this show has been a big letdown. I hope it will get better.

I was doubtful but I was wrong
arnab-1851321 December 2019
To say that this new series is good will be an insult, it's so much better. First off the CGI is exactly like they did it in the movies. Then the whole thing is revolving around one character and the attachment the mandalorian have with it, but it's not boring, it's rather have me latched on to the edge of my seat. If this trend continues then we might have a good TV show after all. Last but not the least the man behind the helmet Pedro Pascal is absolutely marvellous as the mandalorian. There are times he dipicts the character so well that I can almost see his face through the helmet.

bigmin17 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The first three episodes of this show had such promise. There seemed to be an overarching plot with baby yoda and Mando avoiding the 'guild'. Unfortunately it has descended into an incoherent badly acted mess where one episode has no bearing on the next. I'm really disappointed

Started Strong, but Sputtering Out
michael-halding13 December 2019
Overall a great performance by Pedro, but the shows writing, casting, and short run time are causing it to slowly hemorrhage.

The overuse of everyone calling him "Mando" has become a nauseating cliché - he has a name, right? Did everyone call Boba or Jango, "Mando?" No...they didn't. It's tired, please stop while it's still salvageable. That also includes, "this is the way." Retire it while you're ahead.

The writing is stale and has become very predictable. We are able to outline the whole episode within 5 minutes into each one to 99% accuracy - the episodes are not original, lack depth, and emotional development. Episodes 4-6, have been just awful in this aspect. Increase the run time to 1 hour and write some quality stories.

The casting seems lazy like they are recruiting from a local theatre. Sarah really needs to step up her game and recruit some quality actors. Again, with episodes 4-6 they come off as unrehearsed, off balance, almost like they just had their scripts thrown at them. Perhaps, the production team is to blame for this, but something needs to be fixed.

Great Start, Miserable Ending (Season 1)
johndoemofo11 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
The first 3 episodes were outstanding, this is where all the 10 stars and great reviews are coming from, after that third wave feminism takes center stage.

This series had potential to right the wrong inflicted on the Star Wars universe, unfortunately Disney choose to destroy the franchise once and for all by adding Zena-like warriors to episodes 4 - 8 who either beat up, manipulate or overshadow the Mandalorian.

Very Good, but Not as Great as the Rating Suggest
arod_857 January 2020
I enjoyed this show, even better than the last two of the three Starwars movies. Mando is great and I find him so mysterious and interesting which speaks to the actor's and writers' talent because you cannot see his face or facial expressions for the majority of the show. However, I was surprised to see this show as one of the highest rated shows of all time. Almost like by simply being a Starwars production gave the show some slightly undeserved rating cred. The production budget appears low based on the simple background scenery and lack of background characters. However, I Did enjoy the actors and the characters. The storyline is good, but could have been built up a little bit more. I did find the show good and I'm looking forward to season 2.

One word: Cheap.
fsalexmail21 December 2019
"Cheap" is the word that comes to mind more and more often as you watch this. Cheap clichés, cheap hole-ridden plot, cheap decorations, cheap dialogues, and worst of them all - cheap fights staging. It really makes me facepalm watching how in hand to hand combat Mandalorian is repeatedly hit in the near-invulnerable helmet and armor, or how enemies always try their best to act in the least efficient way just to give our hero a chance. The way people praise this piece of crap is just pathetic. It really shows how low their expectations are after the third trilogy.

Kuiil - I have spoken
chema-6503120 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Episode 7 of The Mandalorian for me is the best so far.

One of the main reasons is Kuiil. I really like the Kuiil character. He is so mysterious. He clearly fought for the empire. By way of been a slave labourer. Yet he is repentant and wants to do good in the new galaxy that has been left after the fall of the empire.

From his iconic "I Have Spoken" to his understanding of the old world. It is clear Mando has found an ally he can really trust in this new galaxy arrangements.

I'm really hoping they the Kuiil character gets explored in a lot more detail. Sadly we see that he dies at then end of the episode trying to save The Kid. I dedicate this review to him.

Episode 7 will be a groundbreaking episode as the main protagonists have now seen the "powers" of the kid when he saves Greef Karga from his wound, which results in his reneging on the betrayal of Mando in order to take The Kid away to the remnants of the empire.

Greef Karga & Mando then concoct a new plan to take out the enigmatic The Client. The Client is another character that needs further introduction. We need to be shown what his of his role in the empire was. We soon see he reports to someone called Moff Gideon. He clearly was a admiral in the empire. We now see why The Client was not explored more as Mando, Greef Karga & Cara Dune eliminate him & his stormtrooper henchmen.

We are then shown a few crack black stormtroopers. As well as a tie fighter. From which Moff Gideon exits.

This episode introduces a lot more plot lines that can be developed further. And a new character - Moff Gideon. It's all very intriguing, as to where this rest of the season will go.

There is so much potential, as this episode was closer to the true spirit of what Star Wars has always been about: the fight of good versus evil.

I cannot wait to see where The Mandalorian goes from here. I was very impressed with Episode 7.

thatsgottahurt-117 December 2019
It started out so well. 3 episodes of Star Wars heaven, then 3 episodes of generic nonsense. There has been zero plot advancement in the last 3 episodes. Just cookie cutter filler with cringeworthy characters and no development. The Mandalorian got me to sign up with Disney+ but i may be dropping my sub very soon.

Needs to branch out a bit more....
chema-6503114 December 2019
I love The Mandalorian so far. The story is excellent.

However, in episode 6 I'm starting to see that the show needs to branch out a bit more.

I'm hoping that that the creators are using Season 1 as an introduction to Mando & what his bounty hunter warrior career involved & how it has transitioned after the fall of the empire. Thereby, in ensuing seasons branching out the story & Mando's persona.

I found interesting in episode 6 that Mando is one of the few Mandalorian's left in the universe. This facet could be explored in greater detail.

All first seasons of tv shows act as an introductory narrative for the rest of the series. I am sure The Mandalorian will do likewise.

This is not a criticism, as I love the show. It's just needs to build a more open-ended story & plots.

As a Star Wars fan since I was a child, I just love that the saga is continuing its expansion, but it needs to do so without casting a shadow on the whole premise of the saga. If the creators aren't careful, The Mandalorian could head that way. Personally, I believe this will be the case. I am confident that the show is going to grow into a fantastic show. We just need to give it tome to grow.

I personally loved the appearance of the X-Wings in one of the final scenes. Reminded me of A New Hope's Death Star attack for a minute.

There are so many little narratives been developed, now they just all have to converge into one decisive plot. All the elements are there for sure.

This is Star Wars storytelling done right....Jon Favreau has restored my faith in this franchise...
Kilroy515014 December 2019
Thankfully, they've "swept away" all the elements of the old republic of Disney and not "infected" this series.

The Mandalorian stars with a spaghetti western style lone gunman feeling and the hard-edged Mandalorian, it seems, isn't so hard-edged at the end of his first mission. The sets are spectacular and the older aliens are given the homage they deserve in this series.

I know people are calling the creature "baby Yoda" but it's not Yoda, it's just a baby of his species. And yes, he's super-cute and going to be the Elmo of this years x-mas sales.

Anyway, the feeling of this show takes you back to that same "magic" I felt when I first saw Star Wars. It has the same look, feel, and draw of original Star Wars. It's like stepping back in time when i watch it and it's been a LONG time since i watched something i could "not" be pulled away from.

The Mandalorian has given me hope that Disney hasn't completely destroyed what was, once, one of the greatest of all movie franchises. This series has allowed me to feel like a kid again.

Jon Favreau, you ROCK! You are a Jedi "master" among director / producers and i think you are one of the few who can bring it all back from the dark side that Kathleen Kennedy led it into.

Gives me some cautious hope for Disney Star Wars
MissSimonetta1 December 2019
I haven't been impressed with Disney Star Wars. While The Force Awakens, Solo, and the first two seasons of Rebels were watchable, everything else has been poorly written, pandering, and uninspired (and of course, TLJ is its own subcategory of terrible). I actually didn't even plan on watching this series-- my family got Disney + on a whim and I figured why not.

Turns out THE MANDALORIAN is not half bad. It has a lot of the same vibe as the excellent Clone Wars television series and unlike the sequel trilogy, keeps the nostalgia catnip to a bare minimum. No Jedi, no lightsabers, precious few "member berries"-- it's very nice.

I'm not going to gush just yet. As of this writing, there are only four episodes out and I have been burned too many times by too many TV shows to get too hyped this early, but so far, this actually feels like Star Wars in the classic sense, that fun, pulpy blend of John Ford, Flash Gordon, and Akira Kurosawa. It's a good sign for now.

After many years, finally I get to watch the real Star Wars again
fciocca29 November 2019
I stopped to watch Star Wars in 2002, "Attack of the Clones" was the latest movie of the saga for me, and I hated it. For me that was not anymore the big cult movie that was made in the 80s. When "The Mandalorian" was announced, I didn't want to watch it, but after reading many positive reviews and being pushed from a friend, I decided to give it a shot. Finally, after years, I am watching a real Star Wars production, it remember a lot the original movies, it feels like it. I love locations, I love characters, I love costumes and the Mandalorian is a badass. I am so happy that someone actually listened to fans and decided to create something authentic.

Delivered well
simonkilner28 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
First of all the production and cinematography has the feel of Star Wars and places the story into the universe. The story is not new but is exactly on point. It follows the mandalorian on a mission and shows how he gets by post fall of the empire. The plot is not convoluted by trying to add so many things in and keeps focused. The script is exactly what you would want with some good action with a few twists to give us what you want to see in a mandalorian shoot out with something extra in there that does not take you out of the universe. I hope Disney see what they did right here and how it does not match with were they went wrong in ep 7, ep 8 and solo movie. What's going on? A good Star Wars show, good Star Wars game? Keep going. You are on a roll!

I have watched 3 Episodes and LOVE this show. It is fantastic and I am in love with the main character already. I watched the first few Star Wars Movies and then just lost interest when they got silly. I would recommend this Series to everyone. I love the action and the weapons. The third episode went exactly where I wanted it to! The story line is great and I cannot wait to see the whole series. This is the way!

Interesting plot, cool characters, no forced humor or bad dialogue. Overall a good show. Only problem is that it's kind of annoying that the episodes are coming out on a weekly basis when episodes are only really about 35 minutes but that's up to Disney I guess.

gilchristcw23 November 2019
No silly identity politics, no attempts at political correctness, just a cool character, cool sets, lots of action, amazing special effects. Some people don't like that the crawl isn't there and the music isn't like other Star Wars stories, but I actually prefer it that way because the Mandalorian isn't part of that story. It stands on it's own even if you've never seen Star Wars.

gezaxo23 November 2019
I have never made a rating for a tv show or a movie, but i just love this show. The show holds an almost western texas cowboy style variant of star wars. It's about an mandalorian bounty hunter making his living right after the empire went to ruin. I have only seen the first 3 episodes as of now, but it is amazing! The second episode was good but not AS good as the 1st, the 3rd reclaimed the title of being 9/10

Best Series to date
scottc-5794423 November 2019
I have been a huge Mandalorian fan since the first time I saw Bobba Fett in action in Return of the Jedi. Through out decades of curiosity and my own imagination I have always wanted to see more of the Mandalorians. Jango was decent but didnt have as big of a part as I had hoped. This series far exceeds my years of fantasy. I am very pleased to see how well Disney has done on this series, even with my own scepticism after they bought Lucas Films and the flop of Force Awakens and the Last Jedi. I have seen reviews that baby Yoda is why this does so well but in fact, it is the honor and integrity of this secret society that makes the Mandalorians so intriguing. I want more and cant wait to see where this series goes. If I had to say one word that best describes this intense series I would have to describe it as "Spectacular"!

Movie cut into 8 pieces
missp-6882422 November 2019
I love Star Wars. I like this show. But what I don't like is that the episodes are short, to short. It's looking to a move cut into 8 pieces. I have seen 3 episodes. The episodes have a good Star Wars feeling and the cgi is very good. Because the short episodes you don't really get to know the main character. Hope to see more of him in the next 5 episodes.

The Mandalorian has the potential to be to starwars what Ironman was to the MCU.
irvintang22 November 2019
Jon Favreau help made MCU mainstream with Ironman and now he may do it again for starwars with The Mandalorian. He very well could be the second golden boy for disney next to Kevin Feige.

I put off reviewing the series until I've seen more of it and after episode 3, I have a good idea of where they're going with it and how they're handling the series. Three episodes in and not once did Pedro Pascal took his mask off, we know he could act, we all saw his performance in GoT and it was amazing so his talent is not in question, they made him kept his mask on because the lore and their vision for the series is more important than showing off his talents. This tells me they cared about the lore and story and is what convinced me the series wouldn't disappoint going forward.

In addition, Jon Favreau took all of what we love about Boba Fett and what was cool about him and expanded it in the mandalorian, from the armor that first captured our attention to the jet pack to grapple hook. You can tell this series was made by a fan that love the material. I can't wait to see more.

Disney SW and not bad ????
bloodworia18 November 2019
Big thanks to everyone involved. Along with the new SW game the cycle might have been broken.Until Episode 9 comes out of course.

Two episodes have been released so far. And i enjoyed them quiet a lot. It is hard for me to imagine that good SW content can exist in the Disney SW world.

It's about time
ciansadge17 November 2019
The long awaited show we all needed. Ever since Disney took over Star Wars my interest in the franchise has dipped. Star Wars is one of those properties, that if it isn't done right, it just comes out half baked. While rogue one was mildly enjoyable, and due to my love of Han, solo was ok as well, the main films have been massive let down. So it's about time we got some solid Star Wars content. This show is great, it's more than great, it's near perfect. Everything down to the gritty aesthetic is done perfectly, with no shortage of reference. The story has this casual passing which works tremendously, and the music is brilliant. The original score goes perfectly with the tone of the series. However, while not being major you can tell that the budget was really stretched out. While 100mill is nothing to sniff at, for a series with 8 episodes clocking in at 40mins, it is a relatively tight budget. But for what they had visuals are quite amazing. I love the use of practical effects in film and tv and this show does it right. If your not already watching it you should.

The old school Star Wars vibes are strong with this one...
sandykemp17 November 2019
Finally we have something totally new from Star Wars! Yet it has a familiar feel that just settles you into its world straight away.

George Lucas always did say Star Wars was an amalgamation of eastern and western culture. The Jedi/Sith clearly influenced by the samurai and Buddhism and the criminal underworld/bounty hunters influenced by the old west.

Here the Western vibes are off the chart and I'm loving it! This is the old school Star Wars we glimpsed throughout the original trilogy in places like the Mos Eisley Cantina, Fett's pursuit of Solo and Jabba's palace.

There are countless throwbacks already in the first two episodes but they're done tastefully and in a way that drives the story forward. Expanding upon idea we've only ever had a slight glimpse of in the past and brining in new concepts we had yet to see in a live action Star Wars project.

Pascal so far has done an amazing job as the titular Mandalorian and that's no mean feat with a helmet on at all times! I hope this series will explore the mythology and post Clone Wars/Empire history of the Mandalorians as there so much we don't know about them still.

The support cast have so far been great too. The atmosphere of the show is spot on. The effects are superb with a perfect blend of practical and CGI used in the right places so far. It really does look like a Star Wars movie! It definitely has a Rogue One-like visual vibe to it. Which, in my opinion, is no bad thing.

The episodes are quite short compared to other contemporary shows and I have seen a lot of negative comments about this aspect of the show. However I feel so far the episodes have been very well balanced and haven't went off on meandering tangents (unlike the prequels and even more so the sequels). It does remind me somewhat of the Clone Wars animated series - short instalments but to the point and we'll presented. However that may not come as a surprise since Dave Filoni is involved in both shows.

Perhaps the modern world is too used to online shows being presented in a "series dump" format where all episodes become available at once. I grew up in the 80s and part of the excitement of a serialised show was having to wait to the following week to see the next instalment! We didn't have any alternative back then. However we used that week to get excited for the next episode and talk to our friends about what we think might happen and wait in anticipation to see if we were right. Maybe we all need to get used to that again?

I'm glad Disney has decided to go back to a scheduled release format for this show as I think it really enhances the old school feel of it all. Plus it means that people who don't have the ability to binge watch the whole series aren't at a disadvantage on social media for spoilers etc.

Brought me back to Star Wars
noah-0250216 November 2019
To be honest, I was a huge fan of Star Wars when I grew up and may have watched each episode around 100 times. However now as I've gotten older and not watched them as much I've thought about if I really liked the movies or not. Thankfully however, I watched this episode with somewhat low hopes after seeing a few people talk about Disney+ in a somewhat bad way. However the first episode of The Mandalorian hooked my to my screen and brought me back to when I was younger. Although I have not watched episode two yet, it seems like it will be just as good as the previous one. By the way, this is most probably one of the most well crafter shows I have ever watched. In some parts I even thought that it looked better than certain scenes in the new trilogy. Cannot recommend this show to enough people!

Everything Star Wars should have become
pdzeller11316 November 2019
When George Lucas created the original Star Wars, he wanted to make a "Space Western". Many of the stylistic choices that have since become iconic of the franchise (costumes, sound effects, character design, cinematography) we're made due to budget constraints. What we know as Star Wars now evolved from a simplistic concept. Something I loved about the original Star Wars was the characters, situations, landscapes, and special effects that came from those constraints and the world building that always seemed to just scratch the surface of worlds, and characters that were introduced. One of the primary problems I have with the prequel trilogy and especially the new trilogy, is that the creators seemed only to have the desire to expand the universe rather than give it the depth and grit it deserved. The Mandalorian fixes all of that. Jon Favreau, who despite probably having heaps of money thrown at his budget for this show, keeps it remarkably restrained in special effects and simple storyline. He shows genuine respect for the characters and world he is working in and, in turn, shows respect for the audience the show is targeting. In the two episodes I have watched, I have gotten everything I wanted from the show. The linear and engaging storytelling, the Wild West atmosphere, the Characters you can care about, the grit and grime of the underworld of the Star Wars universe. It's everything I wanted it to be. I've even gotten some high budget Firefly vibes from what is an increasingly in-depth space western. If Star Wars were X-Men then The Mandalorian is Logan. It is legitimately that good.

ralfkotthoff16 November 2019
Seen the first two Episodes and everything I see feels like they nailed it: This is Star Wars (at least to me). But what constantly irritates me is the music. Sorry, I seem to be so much used to the John Williams Sound that the score often feels like a mismatch to me :/

An Entertaining Souvenir to all Star Wars Fans
aubpandey16 November 2019
The show is purely what every Star Wars fan want from Lucas Films. It has its moment of laugh, fight, adventure and mystery. The good thing is the originality of the story without any interference from any previous Star Wars storyline. Even if you didn't watched the Star Wars series, this show has completely different storyline and you won't feel cast away. And if you are a fan of Star Wars then mystery is awaiting for you.

The Mandalorian Makes Me Happy
erin-williams082916 November 2019
This show is great. No, it is. Faverau has done an excellent job. Just amazes me how nitpicking and entitled some of these reviews are.

How often do we come across a show such as this? It's well-written, beautifully shot-CGI looks good, the animatronics are nostalgic, solid voice work, humorous and above all, an intriguing viewpoint from within the SWU.

Forget the few poor reviews crying mediocrity. They couldn't write the instructions of a shampoo bottle let alone create something of The Mandalorian's caliber.

See it for yourself. Even if it's not for you, it's only 35 minute loss.

Perfect new angle?
gavmanart15 November 2019
Great start to a cut back more story oriented show where cgi is a filler instead of a main stay. However, continuity needs to keep the blaster riffle on the same shoulder! c'mon its basics of story boarding, plan the shot and path! This is a fan series from continuous nods to previous episodes to filling gaps you missed by not watching cartoons. All in all a very good effort at bringing light to a shadow of curiosity while fitting in with a cannon revision that keeps some of the book marks from earlier explanations.

Sooooo bad!!!
ddecahedron14 December 2019
I loved Star Wars as a child. Really, I did.

After 40 years I have grown up but obviously the storytelling hasn't. The Mandalorian is terrible. Yes. Let's be realistic.

For all the sad "insert here" nostalgia of the references the series is just bad. I keep trying, hoping, wishing but after 5 or 6 or ok, who cares how many episodes it's just poorly written, acted, directed crap. The 20 seconds worth of Star Wars space imagery cannot make up for the embarrassing childish series.

You have won Disney. Another immature space western to hook In the kids and forgotten the adults.

Lots of hype for nothing
narozsnikz2 January 2020
Many write that this is the real star wars. I don't think so. The season is off to a good start, and the first 1-2 episodes are looks promising, but the standard is constantly sliding down. Nothing more than a Sunday afternoon Disney cartoon. No story, no character development, no lovable characters. Baby Yoda is cute at first but later he is boring just standing and watching. Episode 6 is like an afternoon science fiction from 10 years ago. Much more is needed from season two for this to run permanently as it is currently only sold by the hype and blind fans.

How can anyone rate this well? I suppose if you're like, yeah Star Wars! There is next to no character development. If you want nuance, not here. The plot and tropes are so over used. We open up with a bar fight to show how tough our guy is...really? I am shocked people rate this well.

thesandfly7713 November 2019
Thank God. At no point in this surprisingly good opening episode did anyone sit down with diversity hire number 5 and chat about their feelings, perform astounding feats obviously beyond their character's remit or seek counselling for troublesome interpersonal relationships. So we got a well-paced, 40 minutes of beautifully shot, classic Star Wars channelling Spaghetti westerns. It felt at one point someone took a turn in Mos Eisley 1977 and began following the helmeted dude down the side street rather than Luke to the bar, so nostalgic was the setting/feel; but in no forced way as per J. J Abrahams sytle. This felt like some sort of parallel New Hope tangential fare. The Mandalorian himself came across as a tremendously spartan composite of the Man With No Name and Judge Dredd. Great intruguing climax to set up the following 7 episodes. A stimulating watch for anybody who ever had affection for the original SW trilogy, brilliantly minus the SJW travesty. See what I did there, easily triggered snowflakes? Fingers crossed the season maintains such positive momentum. Fine start.

Only one episode in...
fierfek13 November 2019
Pro - It is better than TLJ. Pro - Clearly has potential. Pro - Open sandbox Con - Needs a storyline introduced. Con - Needs a character behind the helmet. Con - Weird editing and transitions. Con - Voice throws me off.. just doesn't sound right (just me?) Con - I get a lot of B movie or fan made vibes. (pandering feeling)

It is definitely being overhyped by fanboys that are desperate for Star Wars to actually be good... but it does actually have the potential to meet those expectations. I think the show will improve as a storyline unfolds but the first episode was a bit lackluster.

Nobody cares. You aren't special because you LOVE SW more than anyone, and have been a fan all your life, and only you really get what SW is all about. Nobody cares.

This show is great so far. Don't listen to the SW superfan neckbeards who make up a infinitesimal percentage of reviewers here. They hate it which means you should probably like it. If you like Star Wars, and don't have a 4chan login, you should dig it.

stbrads-932-4857688 January 2020

It seriously gets worse the more you watch it. Every episode is like a bad parody. The background music sucks, Yoda is way over played. The last episode attempts some weak storm trooper humour, the best part of the series is that Yoda gets punched in the face.

Frustrating as it failed to deliver, but the potential is there.
pearsemcdonough23 December 2019
There's so much potential, but the story just failed to deliver. It became more monotonous with each episode, which was a shame.

It feels like an old western movie with no real surprises. We're in an era of television series production and storytelling where audiences demand layers of complexity and suspense. The acting is quite good and Pedro is amazing, but I feel that the story is rather basic.

The music, set/costume design, and production is great, and there is a real sense of tapping into the nostalgic traits that made Star Wars such a loved franchise. Unfortunately it doesn't hide the fact that The Mandalorian just isn't very good.

Started great, but quickly lost its wits, charm and storytelling
NixSar22 December 2019
The show indeed seemed to justify its glowing reviews after two episodes - it seemed real within its own set of rules (not Disney-like), acting was good, scenery detailed and interesting, storytelling rich and even kind of edgy, and then...it turned into camp, 80s SF and Xena, then it got a bit better, but never really recovered its wits, charm and storytelling. It was too much to expect from the franchise that has one great film (Empire), two OK films and a bevy of blandness sprinkled with a touch of Lucas' special black and white juvenile thinking.

Star Wars made right. Don't skip this one!
renevilandt10 December 2019
I'm a longtime fan of Star Wars, but The Mandalorian raises the bar, and gives fans something to love.

I was actually skeptical of the show, I usually want lightsabers and Jedi's in my Star Wars stories, but after watching the first episode, I was hooked.

Now I am 5 episode down, and eager for more.

The Cinematography amazing, great variety in locations keeps it interesting, and it's cool to see familiar things from Star Wars, that keep reminding me it's Star Wars, even without lightsabers and such. Acting is way above average, and that is with a lead wearing a helmet, which could have been silly, but so far, it is not a problem at all. The CGI is honestly amazing for a series, most of the CGI would have been good enough for a big blockbuster movie. Another positive, they did as many things as possible with practical effects, and it's just a way better experience, than for example the prequels, were every other scene felt like a bluescreen.

The Mandalorian so far has a great and interesting story, and I can't help but think if Jon Favreau, the creater of the Mandalorian, had he made Solo, that movie could have been so much better. The Mandalorian so far is an amazing show, and I highly encourage any Star Wars fan to see it.

Extremly predictable, but otherwise okay
kythia2 December 2019
I don't know how else to say this, but after the first minute of each episode you know exactly whats going to happen in the next half hour.

It may be different to non-Star Wars fans, but anyone who knows the Mandalorians also knows how black-and-white they think, and are therefore limited in their options. Its either "leave and don't look back" or "brute force to victory or death". They aren't known for their creativity or conversation skills.

That being said, the show is overall well done. A little goofy and full of stock characters, but enjoyable to watch. Pedro Pascal is doing a fine job for being stuck under a helmet 100% of the time. The support actors not so much. Carl Weathers was much better in Colony, and Gina Carano's goofy performance gave me Xena flashbacks to the 90's.

The Mandalorian is not the big throw Disney was probably hoping for, but it can serve as a saving grace for the utterly terrible new trilogy, especially The Last Jedi.

Best Star Wars title in years.
highlander_3152716 November 2019
I saw both ESB, and ROTJ in theaters. I have read hundreds of Star Wars novels since the late 80s. I watched the remastered OT when they came out, and liked some changes, and disliked others. Then, the prequel trilogy. They had good points, and bad points, and really, removing Jar Jar and adding a bit of believable chemistry between Hayden and Natalie would have helped tremendously. Rogue One was decent, Solo was not that bad, and then. Then we have the new ones. Someone, a lot of someones, need to be fired and barred from ever having any say in anything that goes onto a local news television channel.

Then, The Mandalorian comes along. It's like Disney realized how badly they screwed up, and let someone write a Star Wars universe based show that actually LIKES Star Wars, and wanted to tell a story about a previously unknown character making his way through life five years after the fall of the Empire. And it works. This show has everything that the fans who grew up watching non Disney Star Wars could want. I do realize that as I write this, we are only two episodes in, but, every single thing that I have seen fits into the thirty five years of Star Wars history pre Disney. And it is wonderful.

Boring, pointless, irrelevant.

Had high expectations and excitement, but feel massively let down.

armory-6773412 November 2019
I came into this thing not expecting much. I disliked the last two Disney Star Wars films and was expecting this to be much the same. I have never been so happy to be so wrong. There is more originality and style in the first episode than everything else in the series Disney has produced combined. I cried when it ended because I never thought seeing a Star Wars product would be this fresh and satisfying ever again. That feeling alone is worth giving the show a 10 based on only the first episode.

krogchoi-6937629 December 2019
How can this show have such a high rating ?! The days when imdb's rating would give you a good idea of what a movie is worth seem to be long gone. There is no way this comes even close to masterpieces like The Wire or Breaking Bad. It seems that nowdays, people either vote 10 or 1. So be it ! My true rating for this show would be 5/10 Set and settings is nice, but acting is terrible, and the script ... non existant ? The whole season could be summed up in one 50 mins episode if it had the pace of a show like Game of Thrones

CrocodileEMT13 November 2019
Finally a Star Wars show worth watching!! It's about time Disney did something right!! I'm officially addicted!! The $7/mo subscription fee for this show alone, would be worth it!! DON'T get any ideas though, Disney!! I wish I could build my own "Bounty Droid" at Star Wars Galaxy Edge; I'd literally hop in the car and drive there just for that!! Way to slay it, Disney!! I only wish you'd do more episodes than only 9 per season!!! Can't wait for more! I guess I'll be staying up late on Friday nights just for more!!

Beautifully Bad
josiahplatte13 November 2019
Dull chronological plot was dragged along by ridged dialogue. Emotionless humor. Slow paced yet the shallow plot was rushed. Lazy editing and laughably bad music score, reminded me of a cheesy 70s tv show with the exception of beautiful CGI and impressive sets. Overall it was just unexciting.

Does not feel right...something is out of place...
fasilhayat13 December 2019
I have always been a star wars fan. Seen all the movies since my childhood and played many games...but something feels wrong here. There is no main story arch and some of the effects and scenery seems to be clumpsy and far from genuine. It feels like Star Wars sometimes, but then again bad acting and bad lines makes it far from the real deal. I had hoped it to feel like a 'Game of Thrones' quality Star Wars TV series. The music is also far from John Williams sound, which in my opinion is also part of the Star Wars feeling. I am a bit disappointed and it feels like it is being too hyped up. I was sincerely hoping for something better.

It's about as good/bad as Xena: The Warrior Princess (1995-2001)
p-baenziger29 November 2019
Don't try to figure out character motivations, because they don't make sense on more than the most basic surface level. Don't expect a compelling plot. This isn't isn't the Expanse. It isn't even Babylon 5, or Battlestar Galactica. Not even close.

But it is Star Wars, which is more than can be said about some of the Disney Lucasfilm movies.

Jon Favreau Redeemed Star Wars!
mattyj76-764-68716212 January 2020
Wow, The Mandalorian is superb. Finally, a Star Wars follow up worthy of the originals. I echo previous reviews in saying this series feels like Star Wars. Excellent cinematography, characters, storyline etc. I wish Jon Favreau would have been at the helm of the last 3 garbage Star Wars movies. I recommend this series to old and new Star Wars fans alike. Well done!

I like reading the bad reviews...
cartoon81211 January 2020
... In this instance, The reviewers who claim to be 'Star Wars' fans, and don't like this series. This is very Star Wars'esque, Star Wars'ish and Star Wars'y. (With a little Clint Eastwood thrown in.) It's a good story told within the Star Wars universe. Some claim bad acting. Well? The original Star Wars had bad actors. (Outside of Harrison Ford.) And is one the best Sci-Fi movies every made. This is a very good watch, a little short. Only 5 hours and 15 minutes. Well worth a 2nd viewing. 'I have spoken.'

Star Wars but essentially uninspired
Cpt_Acid7 January 2020
The story evolves in episodes 1, 7 and 8. The rest are just self-contained cliche based filler episodes. A side quest episodes of sorts.

The budget for a TV series is not enough to produce epic modern sci-fi environments. I'm certain they did the best they could with what was at their disposal. The environs and ambiance remind me of B sci-fi movies from the '80 and '90. They all took place in post apocalyptic desert landscapes or barren volcanic planets. Run down mortar and concrete villages are not adequate settings for a space age adventure. Just like landscapes they move through in small groups, the characters are also few and reduced to essentials. Surroundings in general are passable, but not beautiful or interesting to look at. Star Wars lore is there in traces, safe for some Mandalorian ethos as is to be expected. Precarious post imperial political situation is not discussed at all, for example, till the final episodes.

So you've got largely filler story irrelevant to the main story arc, unfolding over uninspiring and bleak empty expanses of wasteland landscapes. I've watched it all cause I'm an old Star Wars fan.

My recommendation - you want a better and more concise storytelling movie experience - watch episode 1 then 7 and the last one 8. The rest are irrelevant and stereotypical trite.

All in all, the Little Yoda is cute. And Werner Herzog is a legend.

wagnerit4 January 2020
The Mandalorian is like inspired from the real trinity except, it explains a simple bounty hunter's travels. He is a man who tries to stay alive just like each one of us does every day. This makes The Mandalorian closer to us and we feel it. Besides all of these, it is real Star Wars which means very heroic. Just give a chance, you won't regret it.

Fun, but inconsequential
joanitoad2 January 2020
I'm quite surprised about the high ratings to this show. I mean, this is a product that is really WELL DONE. Art direction is superb, cinematography, FX... visually overhelming. That's perfect. Acting is in general ok. Many familiar faces playing little roles, which is awesome. But, the story...

Episodes are too short to be substantial. Too predictable. Simple scripts (which is not bad at all), but hollow. Simplistic action adventurettes that can be foreshadowed after watching the intro. Nothing really enriching is being told. Ok, there is a little story each episode. This is storytelling, text, but underneath this there is nothing. People can say that this feels like true Star Wars universe, but I thinks this is only an illusion. Some ATs, X wings, robots and that Tatooine feeling can provide this feeling, but IMO, fandom loves here the same things they hated in The last Jedi.

I think the entire series lacks from a consistent story carried from the beginning to the end. I don't think autoconclusive episodes work here very well. Most of them are simply expendable. Only 1, 3, 7 and 8 are worth to be told. And eve son, they're too basic. They don't demand from us.

At the end, this is pure fandom service. And as much I admire Jon Favreau, I think a series like this one deserved mucho more.

We feel redeemed, finally!
HiMoO230 December 2019
How any recent Star Wars story could be really into Star Wars these days. If so, and we ought to select, it will be this incredibly heartwarming and magnificent piece of art; The Mandalorian. The force here is real, the force here comes from the beating heart of our beloved theme of Star Wars, which's hope. There is no overpowered, Marvel-like, self-centered, money-making or politically corrected persona. Just the force, and no more. This is our and only Star Wars in this era of the forced and abused force. May the force be with you Mando.

No pandering writing, no forced awkward humor and no manipulative fan service. This is real Star Wars
OwenReallyCool28 December 2019
After a series of underwhelming and forgettable movies, I am so glad The Mandalorian exists. It succeeds where the sequel trilogy fails and this is exactly what modern Star Wars should've been from the start because this is what happens when you get talented people to make something new from this beloved franchise. The fact that this show is as good as it is is a miracle.

What Daredevil did for Marvel, The Mandalorian did for Star Wars. This is the most satisfied I've been with anything Star Wars in so long. I want Season 2 and the Obi-Wan show now!

Disney+ starts off live-action Star Wars with a BANG
jaredkjacoby28 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
When Disney announced a live-action show on their brand new streaming service, I was cautiously optimistic. I enjoy a lot of the Star Wars content that has come from Disney, but I wasn't sure how this show would turn out. In fact, I didn't even know what it was really about. After getting the Disney+ app, I started watching this and oh man... This show is nothing short of fantastic.

I loved every single moment of Mando's character in the show. His character is pretty complex despite being someone who wears a mask 24/7. Pedro Pascal's acting is top notch. The character is badass, but he is not invincible. He will take a beating several times and comes close to dying occasionally. This made the fights more intense to watch . It is really satisfying to see him come out on top. Cara Dune was a great rebellious character as well. She was only in for a few episodes, but I want to see more from her. She was badass and she had perfect chemistry with Mando. Now the elephant in the room, BABY YODA. This baby is ADORABLE! Every moment on screen with Baby Yoda was full of pure joy. His or her relationship with Mando was also pure and delightful. I actually was indifferent to Mando until he met the baby and saved him or her from the droid. The supporting cast is excellent and there are plenty of twists from them. One twist was with a reoccurring character that really surprised me. It was when Greef turned back on the plan to capture Mando and the baby and help them defeat the Empire figures that were tracking them down. I thought for sure he would just be another villain in Mando's way, but his heel-faced turn shocked me. The visuals are gorgeous in this show. The effects are spot on, the environments are beautiful, the makeup and costumes are fantastic, the creature designs are creative and polished and Baby Yoda looks especially precious with the animatronic work. I thought he was CGI at first, but he was created using practical effects and I think that it looks very impressive. The battle scenes on the last episode is where the visual effects truly shine. Speaking of battle scenes, the action sequences were beautifully shot and edited and they were a joy to watch. Some of the scenes did have some lighting that I thought was a little too dark to see everything happening, but overall, the battle scenes were great. The story was really good as well, but the story truly shines with the characters and their relationships. Every episode was fantastic. There was no weakest episode this season. Each episode was full of great character moments, humorous moments, scary moments and action-packed moments to enjoy. I really wish this season was one episode longer, but I cannot wait to see season 2.

The first season of The Mandalorian was outstanding and it's my favorite piece of Star Wars from Disney so far. Baby Yoda is certainly a plus, but that is just the icing on the cake. This show is everything I wanted from a live-action Star Wars and I am excited to see what the future seasons will bring. If you have not watched the show for what ever reason, do it. Whether you are a Star Wars fan or not, you will not be disappointed.

A Wonderful Departure from the Main Story
kjproulx28 December 2019
Whether you're talking about a disagreement with a family member or simply how you have differing opinions about a movie or television show, it's always nice when the dust settles. The Mandalorian felt like that for me. Over the last few years, the Star Wars fan base made me never want to browse the internet ever again. I just wanted to come out and state that people are allowed to like what they like. Thankfully, it resolved itself (mostly) on its own with the release of The Mandalorian. Now, I'm sure there are still a lot of haters of this franchise as a whole, but I think this is a great series so far and the majority of the audience seems to agree.

Throughout the majority of this season, we follow a Mandalorian on the outskirts of the galaxy, bounty hunting and protecting a young child that seems to be of the same race as a famous Star Wars character in Yoda. Going on a new adventure in nearly every episode, it kind of feels like an old serial, where you can watch random episodes without being lost. With that said, it definitely becomes a much more focussed story by the final few episodes, leaving you wanting more. I'm absolutely curious where the next season is going to head.

Although there are a couple of weaker episodes, this show is fantastic for the most part. There are two episodes that take detours, which was still a nice watch, but really did nothing for the overall narrative. I loved the fact that new directors were given a shot at live-action. From Bryce Dallas Howard directing a big-budget production for the first time to Dave Feloni working on his first live-action piece of entertainment, it really felt like a lot of creative voices, that never clashed once, which is sadly how the feature films feel at the moment (in the Star Wars franchise).

Even though it's not actually him most of the time, Pedro Pascal was great casting for this central character and secondaries like Gina Carano and Carl Weathers all brought their A-Game. This is easily the best Carano has ever been. These filmmakers are utilizing her best attributes to their fullest and it really shines on-screen. If for nothing else, the talent involved in this show is truly something special. On top of that, this show visually looks incredible.

With the classic feel of the original trilogy, this show is practical, far more than it's ever digital. The time and care that was put into these set pieces is astounding. I found my jaw on the floor for the way a set looked over how well a plot twist worked throughout the entire season. That's not a sleight on Jon Favreau's writing, because it's actually really great, it's just that the visuals are truly the standout here. If television shows received Oscars, I would absolutely nominate this series for Set Design.

In the end, The Mandalorian shows tremendous potential for the future of Star Wars. Being such a simple story with elements that could easily make this a much grander story, later on, it has me hooked. I can see this becoming one of those shows that continues to be talked about for years to come, especially with short seasons, leaving fans eager to continue. Well-written and well-made throughout each and every episode, I have nothing but praise for this departure from the main Star Wars stories. I highly recommend checking this series out. Season one is great!

This is Star Wars
radnen28 December 2019
Within minutes I was hooked to this show as if I were an audience first discovering Star Wars many decades ago. The atmosphere, lighting, tight dialog and pacing were spot on for the Star Wars aesthetic that we have come to know and love. From Ludwig Göransson's perfectly apropos, sweeping soundtrack to Idoine and Fraser's masterful control over lighting, and the Chiaroscuro effect found evident throughout the Star Wars franchise - and don't forget those cross-fades! This is cinema at it's absolute best, a resurgence, or dare I say, a Renaissance in terms of the experience.

Pedro Pascal is brilliant as the stoic and stalwart Mandalorian. Though laconic, his few words and postures convey a waterfall of emotion and purpose without crossing the line into farce exposition or inappropriate laughter. Furthermore, the supporting cast; Gina Carano, Carl Weathers and the legendary director Werner Herzog were as brilliantly cast in their roles as Ginacarlo Esposito was for his, the brooding and sharp Moff Gideon.

For a TV show the sound production, CGI and Special FX were as astounding as any theatrical release due in great part to the backing of Disney and the talented writers, producers and directors, the names of Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi, and Bryce Dallas Howard.

The Asset that we have come to know and love stood tall on the shoulders of giants, showing there is a special place in our hearts for Special FX and not CGI. The idea to use real world props gave a grounding, or realistic portrayal that could not be expressed otherwise, and it shows to great effect.

With that said, the Mandalorian is far more Star Wars than the recent trilogy could ever hope to achieve, and it is due in no small part to the passionate crew, but most importantly, the creators paying special attention to the small details, the narrative details that made Star Wars, Star Wars.

Please Watch Episode 7
yungracecar19 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Season one started out strong, planting the right seeds and really itching the spot for Star Wars fans. The middle of the season started to introduce new locations and new people for seemingly no reason, which had a lot of fans worried (myself included). I see a lot of recent reviews saying that there's no plot, characters have no purpose, etc. WATCH THE LATEST EPISODE. Numerous returning characters are tied in, and a thickening plot is established that reaches back to the first episode. This could set the standard for the rest of the series, and shows us that they care about the show more than simply throwing in useless filler that we'll never see again. There's really no telling which characters they could utilize in the future that they've set up in season one, and I'm stoked.

Additionally, to those of you saying that the premise of saving baby Yoda doesn't make sense, I pose a question: how can you watch the series so far and draw the conclusion that Mando is more of a "ruthless bounty hunter" than a man of honor? Have you ever seen him take a life when he doesn't have to? Why would he go against everything he believes in and watch an IG unit kill a baby? Just baffling. Please re-watch if you really can't grasp the nature of our protagonist, it's not that hard.

Finally! Star Wars feels as though it's back! All the characters we meet have meaning, purpose and we care for them. Filoni is truly the future of Star Wars! With the let down of the sequels surely Kennedy must realise she has a creative genius under her rank!

The Mandalorian stands out from all other Disney Star Wars projects! If you're looking for a gripping, action packed spaghetti western style Star Wars series, then this is for you! This series brings perspective to the galaxy far far away and shows the gritty reality of life within it!

Mando's Mystery
treshanfernando19 December 2019
The Mandalorian isn't just a space western. It's deeper than that. The characters are layered, mysterious and, honestly, the best part of this show. A severe lack of dialogue between Mando and "baby Yoda" doesn't stop it from becoming the driving force of the story.

The show's slow trickle of information, however, leaves much to be desired in terms of creating a satisfying narrative. Episodes go by with almost no addition to the overarching plot and the mysteries simply stagnate. The viewer suffocates, languishing in a state of mystery, that feels eternal.

That being said, when the story does deal with the plot, it is always gripping and intense. Each episode, despite not always being connected to the larger plot, is always tense and fun to watch. A TV budget does not hinder it's capabilities of being a fully fledged Star Wars story. The explosions and creatures are always a treat to see on screen.

Disregarding a few narrative issues, The Mandalorian is a phenomenal work of TV magic. Tense and frighting but also adorable and heartwarming, the show is truly fit to join the Star Wars canon.

Baba Yods FTW
Mike_O_Dwyer4 December 2019
What The Mandalorian most reminds me of is that 70s show, "Kung Fu", with David Carradine. Every week a kick-ass stranger would walk into a new place and, well, kick-ass. It was a western with kung-fu, what more could you possibly want! Lots of TV shows followed that formula back then because while TV westerns had been popular, and cheap to make, the whole set up had become formulaic. So they played with the format and we ended up with Westerns with Kung Fu, westerns with apes, westerns with cowboys in the big apple. When cop shows took over they were basically westerns, just with different badges better guns and squealing tyres.

The Mandalorian is pretty much more of the same. Space cowboy rolls into town and 30 minutes or so pass by with ropey dialogue and whatever bits of cool are needed to make you forget about the ropey dialogue. That it's Star Wars is a bonus because I grew up with it. Baba Yods gets it an extra star.

It's an okay old timey good time TV series that does the trick of hitting those nostalgia beats while playing to fanboy nerdgasms, which is great. But after a few episodes it's beginning to feel tired. Hopefully it will find more solid ground to explore than 3 act formulas from old TV shows.

Competent, but also overrated - TL;DR at the end
daemonxhun2 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Villains of the week

After I've watched 4 episodes, I'm finally starting to figure out what kind of series this really is. The Mandalorian doesn't really feel like it has a constantly evolving story, unlike most other modern TV shows that have a finite end. It rather feels like a corny "villains of the week" type of show from the mid-90's that can go on forever, it feels like Hercules: The Legendary Journeys or Xena: The Warrior Princess.

What differentiates it and makes it better in some ways though is that it is more professionally made - it has a stronger technical (and possibly artistic) background. The cinematography is excellent for TV show standards and the blend of practical and CGI elements work very well here. However, in almost every other aspect - aspects that really count in presenting an enjoyable experience that will be stuck with the viewer - The Mandalorian simply underdelivers. Not just compared to the other two shows I've mentioned but in general.

But just to stick with my two examples, Xena and Hercules, yes, they are corny as hell, yes, they are tongue-in-cheek, but they are actually fun to watch. They have real, well-defined characters, humorous and self-reflective dialogues that often work really well, and enjoyable little stories throughout the episodes. Both series are simple and you can criticize them for a lot of reasons, but I feel like they were made by passionate people and in the end, it shows.

Emotional sterility

The Mandalorian is clearly a better-made show but it also lacks some kind of spirit and heart that would make it truly resonate with me. It often feels emotionally distinct and sterile, just like Rogue One. For example, most of the dialogues feel artificial instead of natural. Therefore, in the rare moments when someone wants to express their emotions, it feels like if a robot (in the conventional sense) would try to act like a human - it just comes out wrong and feels wrong.

This kind of almost autistic approach to emotions also shows in other aspects of the show as well, such as the soundtrack. It feels like every time it takes a step in the right direction, it immediately takes two steps back. From an emotional standpoint, the show is just as conflicted as Darth Vader was in Return of the Jedi and overall, it's one of the main reasons that hold it back to become something better.

It feels like the creators feared to make the series emotional because they wanted to create a gritty and serious story - again, just like Rogue One. Why? Possible because in this postmodern world of ours, the masses simply love and praise everything that has nihilism and darkness in it. However, through writing and shooting, they also realized that a story without emotions and relatability is not worth telling, so they stuck in this eternal conflict between gritty+serious and fun+adventurous and they failed to balance the two sides out - even though it would have been entirely possible, just look at The Empire Strikes back.

Overarching Conflict

Unfortunately, the series is just as conflicted and messy in other aspects as well, such as character-development, pacing, narrative and storytelling, general structure, etc. Sometimes I feel like a really simple story without any worthy world-building and character-building is drawn out for 40 minutes. In other times, I feel like the given story would require more screentime to be explored thoroughly, but instead, we jump between different scenes in a fast and erratic manner. Sometimes nothing is happening for tens of minutes, and sometimes important scenes don't have enough time to breath and the viewer doesn't have enough time to take them in. This makes it really hard to care at all about what's happening on the screen.

A good example for all of these is the latest episode, in which basically after three sentences, the Mandalorian and the woman with the child almost act like they have fallen in love together, without any previous relationship development between them at all, while the whole "teaching the locals how to fight under two minutes" part was just as laughable and cheesy. These type of scenes worked a million times better in the A-Team 30+ years ago. Moments like these can't work without proper build-up or without hitting the required tone for the series - the suspense of disbelief is immediately shattered when they try to do these in a show that they also want to be taken seriously.

I'm not saying that it's impossible to tell strong stories in which you start to care about the characters in a short amount of time - it's totally possible, but the creators behind this show are simply not talented enough for that. Or at the very least, they would need to write the dialogues better in order for them to be more expressive, and they should also manage the timing of the script better so it could be more effective. It can be done, The End of the F***ing World is a great example. In that series, every moment, every scene, every dialogue has a meaning and it constantly builds towards something, while you also start to care about the characters after a very short time.

Conclusion

If I want to say a video game analogue, I think that the episodes of this show feel like secondary side-missions from above-average open-world/RPG titles. They are passable and sometimes have their fun moments - but that's all. Go there, do this, bring me that, etc. But at least, in the world of games you also have the presence of interactivity that can elevate even a simple story to greater heights.

Now this all may sound very negative, but just to be clear, I'm not saying that The Mandalorian is bad. I'm just saying it's not very good either and I think a lot of people would definitely need a reality check here. In the past years, a lot of bad things came out in the world of Star Wars and I think a negative side-effect of it is that now whenever a mediocre or slightly above average, competent work comes out, people automatically tend to overpraise it. And this is the case with The Mandalorian as well.

TL;DR: The Mandalorian is a competently made show that has its moments, but overall, there are far better TV shows to choose from if you really want to watch something - even in its genre. The Star Wars name alone won't make anything instantly unmissable.

A return to everything awesome (non-jedi) Star Wars
bquick9423 November 2019
The only thing that sucks is that the episodes are so short! Why put all that money into set/costume design if you're not going to make the most of it. At least 50 minute episodes. I obviously know nothing of making shows but I feel it really messes up the pacing of the story with such short episodes that I have to wait a week for. If I could binge it all at once it wouldn't really matter. Other than that so far so good, western movie vibes throughout, slow burn in a good way. Very immersive which is why it is a tragedy that they cut the episodes so short.

Back to basics
birgervanlangenhove23 November 2019
I'm really liking this show up till now (Ep. 3). Easy viewing, accesible Star Wars series. It's not overly violent and I'm going to watch it with my son of 7 who is a big Star Wars fan and I think it wil be very enjoyable for him too. I don't mind the short episodes because it leaves me wanting more of it. I've been a Star Wars fan for 40 years and the last trilogy wasn't all that good. But I really like it that this series is taking it somewhat back to the basics.

So much better than the new trilogy!
DaeTheRebel23 November 2019
Like Rogue One, and unlike TFA/TLJ, this just feels like Star Wars, you know? I love it. I've watched the 3 episodes that are out multiple times and I can't wait for the next one. With each new episode I get more and more hooked. I'm completely baffled by reviews asking "why is this so slow?" First of all, it's not really that slow. There's plenty going on. And it's okay to take a rest from meaningless flashy action all the time to actually develop some character, story, and emotion. Or to just enjoy the scenery in this vast, beautiful, and interesting galaxy with planets and space between them that take time to traverse. But that's time well spent.

In fact, one of my biggest grievances with the new trilogy is that it moves too fast, bouncing from one stupid plot point to another, never taking the time to dwell on events even as significant as the deaths of Han and Luke (don't get me started 🙄). Its breakneck pace made the universe seem so small and easily explored.

The Mandalorian has action but it also has substance. It taps into the visceral, real-life feeling we love about the "war" part of Star Wars. It uses the Force but also reminds us there's a great big galaxy out there with countless individuals outside the Skywalker family who have been devastated by the war and the empire. And that life for them indeed goes on after the Empire's fall, so far in profoundly interesting ways.

More please! And thank you, THANK YOU everyone who works on this show for understanding what fans truly loved about Star Wars in the first place.

Incredible So Far
atjudkins18 November 2019
I'm really impressed with this show so far. The first two episodes were incredible. The action is incredible and the special effects are big screen quality. The writing is superb. Every character, no matter how minor, feels fleshed out. I'm convinced that Jon Favreau is the man to go to when starting up big projects. He nailed Iron Man to kick off the MCU. He killed it with the jungle book to start off Disney's live action remakes. And now he's proved to me that Disney+ actually has the potential to make tremendous Star Wars TV show. Pedro Pascal is great as well. Though you don't see he's face (as of two episodes in) The Mandalorian feels incredibly relatable and sometimes funny. The show has heart as well. No spoilers here, but there's a character introduced in the final moments of the first episode that I love. But since the introduction caught me a lot by surprise I'll let you experience it for yourself.

Finally someone who gets it.
themadcamel17 November 2019
Finally they get it right. This is what the new films have been missing all along. 3 simple elements when combined together make what was so great about the three originals. Spaghetti Western, Samari, Space Opera. That's it... It's that's simple. The perfect recipe for an enjoyable star wars flick. Sure there's gonna be some that don't like it, but hey! they can still listen to Justin Bieber or go watch Fast and Furious 13.

baslanters17 November 2019
This is what Star Wars is all about. It has a perfect balance between puppetry and CGI and a great story in a premise far far away. I really love the references to the original trilogy. There's little dialogue though, they let the visuals do the talking just like in the old Spaghetti Westerns. It's like Clint Eastwood being a bounty hunter in the Star Wars Universe. I love this SHOW John FAVREAU!!

Wow just wow, all great stories have an adult as lead, as a kid I looked to Superman, Batman, Indiana Jones, Bionic Man and Optimus Prime as cinema role models. Kids don't want boys and girls as leaders The Mandalorian tells the story through the lens of a man and real struggles men and women can relate. Love the two first episodes keep up the good work.

Just plain terrible.
Shabrese21 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Look I'm a Star Wars fan. I am. But to see a 9 average rating on this show? Seems like Disney employees were paid to fluff it up or something. No freaking way.

Potential spoilers but I have to list why this is just terrible. Note My feedback is only bases watching one episode.
First what the heck is the story? Seems random to no end with bits of randomness thrown in there. Doesn't feel like a well written deep show. With all the amazing deep shows out nowadays I expect more.
The show has a poor plots that doesn't pay attention to detail. Examples: why the heck learn to ride a 'horse' when he has a ship, anyone else notice the endless bad guys at the camp he finds? Who are they and why are they there and so many? Too convenient to just be shot. How can he kill multiple bad guys but the 'horses' got him so easily? Why didn't the robot and him know about each other? Why does the robot have different instructions?
This definitely felt like a bad western but set in Star Wars. He too easily finds missions to execute with no real rationale. Does he have a moral compass to choose which missions? Who is the black guy playing? Friend or coworker? Too many times someone would say obvious thing aloud like "they got us pinned" duh. He gets the machine gun and starts shooting up the place feels like every bad shoot em up movie and over glorified with hero music playing in the background.
Bad acting and over dramatic all around. I feel like the actors are just speaking lines but not adding any emotion. The blue guy in the beginning was terrible. Was he supposed to be comedic relief or just talk us to death. music generally sounded over dramatic. The scenes with the blacksmith snd the music while hammering felt very 90s. They blast the door open and 3 seconds later open it even though the gun is far away. Only 1 guy stayed inside to get shot!? He shoots the robot in the head but all the other shots from the army outside didn't kill the robot? Then...then he plays with the baby using his finger. Why!?????
I felt NO emotion whatsoever, even when they tried to do random flashbacks of him as a kid. I didn't feel empathy. I didn't laugh once. Nothing. I just watched and watched and nothing ran through my body. I felt no connection to the character.
I'm not sure if it's bad acting or bad writing or both. Honestly I would have preferred if the main character was silent. His talking made him seem like a beat cop even though he's supposed to be this bad a$$ bounty hunter. Sounded like Sean William Scott a bit.

It was painful to watch. Even for a First episode. i expected a lot more. Just terrible.

I'll watch episode 2 to give it a shot but I don't have high hopes. the graphics were ok but I still expected better from lucasfilms. This felt like a low budget fan movie honesty.

Soulless and boring to the bone, Star Wars at it's worst.
jevries16 November 2019
With storytelling, or better put boringtelling, and structure so basic and predictable that I rather watch an episode of the '80's A-team series. It feels like going to Disneyland watching one of those live shows where the decor is more important than the content. It has moments where that Star Wars feel drips through but overall it's not there and lacks soul, fun and intelligence.

If a boring plot, horrible dialog, terrible acting, overblown and unoriginal music, a total lack of anything resembling a theme is your thing, this might be for you.

Yes, the special effects are very good. The world building could have been interesting, but man this is terrible.

Episode 1 is such a fun jump into this new part of the universe. We get some really interesting ideas and mysteries setting up the rest of the season and some amazingly fun star wars action scenes, sets and characters.

For the 1st episode of a Star Wars Show you can't ask for much more!

Gets worse by the week
MovieCriticOnline21 December 2019
And it was bad when it started and I can't imagine it actually keeps getting worse. And all the praise is either from paid reviewers or people that are so desperate for anything decent.

The acting is Razzie worthy. And this is Jon Favreau creation? How embarrassing. There is zero plot. Zero interesting characters. It's really just a feminist and SJW dream come true and sad because the visuals and sets are amazing.

This is not science fiction
jonasatmosfera14 November 2019
Disapointing,

The Mandalorian is only a western with people wearing funny costumes and shooting each other.

Instead of lead bullets we have, we have flashes of light, instead of horses we have weird animals and we have a lone-wolf type of guy....

There is no science fiction in it, just the old ideas, stereotypes, and scenes that we have seem in countless old westerns.

Boring, dull and as dry as Tatooine.

Baby Yoda is somewhat keeping me hooked to see what will come Technical its 1 star + 1 star for cute Yoda but still unwatchable 1 star

nothing fits the Mandalorian is fighting like a total noob and story is basically not existing or stupid

just watch the 20min Yoda time and you have all seen what is important

In a better direction than the other recent Star Wars... but
Youwillhateme14 November 2019
The acting wasn't that great, which is a shame. The approach also seemed a little too flippant for Star Wars. There is a fine line between having humorous characters like C3PEO and Chewbacca and forcing these silly over the top comedians doing Woody Allen shtick

And the Clint Eastwood voice for Mandalorian didn't match. It seemed out of place. Even his walk seemed odd and his character seemed odd and not as cool as Boba Fett. It was the wrong actor for this. His intro was a silent cool hero, but then he came off as a whiny beta male.

I'm sure there is an enormous thirst for authentic Star Wars so anything that remotely captures the original trilogy is applauded even if it if filled with problems.

Why not just make this about Boba Fett? Instead they just too many scenes from a New Hope and added them. The bar scene. The Sand People scene where Luke looks through the binoculars and then all of of a sudden a sand person appears. Here it's just replaced with those riding monsters that look like piranhas.

The look and feeling was right, but the characters and story was not that good, so far. and I blame the writing. Just bad dialogue (too sitcomish) and weak actors, accept Werner, which was good.

First episode was a lackluster. So let's hope it gets better.

Thank god for the Mantalorian, the last 3 star wars where a real joke, Finn and Pie are super annoying, Ray is awful, Kylo ren is a joke, and the rest, they failed on every aspect and its really sad.

Far from the original series of 1977 and the newer star wars of 2000. Rise of the Skywalker will fail.

The Mandalorian does have this old good magical star war vibe and i love it... i feel the magic is back and its going to over shadow the terrible last movies.

I'm shocked to see this show having reviews this good, especially from critics. For me, one of the worst TV shows I watched in my life. It looks like it's filmed by someone that never filmed anything in his life. Script is boring, plot and characters also. And acting, that's another level of bad. From me 1 bacause I cannot give 0.

Overall it was pretty boring.The helmet gets old fast, enough already. Plot pretty meh and moving along uninterestingly. Was there music? Nothing that made an impression. Definitely hoped for more, lets see what the next one brings. 'See' is a much better new series. Edit - gave up. Honestly don't understand the good reviews. I can see it appeal to kids.. but there's little substance here. Whatever plot may exist is poorly developed.

This is possibly one of the most boring pieces in the Star Wars canon. The action isn't intense, the storyline is total drab, baby Yoda is WAY overrated. There's no magic, no emotion, nothing special. Huge let down for me. I wanted it to be what it thinks it is...but it's just not. It looks like Star Wars...but that just isn't enough.

Watches Like Videogame
NosworthyG29 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I read somewhere that The Mandalorian was originally going to be a video game but instead got converted into a TV series. I don't know if this is true, but it seems like the only way to make sense of the first two episodes of the series.

The Mandalorian looks great and full credit must go to the artists, set designers, cinematographers etc. These are frills that can elevate a show, but at the end of the day it's the story telling that matters most and The Mandalorian's first two episodes play like a series of side quests to pad run time with no real bearing to the central narrative.

The show opens well enough with a relatively generic bar scene brawl. We are shown that our protagonist is someone not to be messed with and who is happy dealing in the grey areas of morality. But soon we are exposed to what I feel was the greatest creative error of the show which is that our main character never removes his helmet. Whilst this may be part of Star Wars lore, it creates a comical situation where we continually cut to reaction shots where we just look at a close up of a helmet. It's hard to get emotionally invested in a character with no facial expression and to make matters worse, the character talks with no emotion if and when he talks. This would not be an issue for a side character or villain, but to have your protagonist utterly devoid of personality immediately drains audience interest in his trials and tribulations.

This results in not being able to establish meaningful relationships between characters. The first real dialogue in the show is with a blue alien who turns out to be our first bounty. Having been captured by our protagonist, he is then taken onto his spaceship and proceeds to talk ad nauseum in an attempt at an amusing dialogue that unfortunately, for me, fell flat. The Mandalorian is silent throughout this until Blue-boy is mercifully (for the audience) frozen. So not only do we get no facial expression to understand our protagonist but we also get no dialogue.

Later, in a side quest that neither furthers character, narrative or world/lore building, a random small orange alien teaches the Mandalorian to ride what appear two legged sperm monsters. We get a 5 minute montage of our protagonist falling off the monsters, presumably getting as frustrated as the audience (we cut to his expressionless helmet). At this point, the tangerine alien, who is helping our protagonist for reasons that are largely unexplained (something about invaders causing a disturbance - that is never seen on screen - to his planet), tells him with a swell of music that as a Mandalorian he should be able to master sperm monster riding. Then we cut to the Mandalorian's mask and take cues from the music as to what he's thinking. The outcome of all this, our protagonist rides the sperm monster to his destination and then he is at his destination. End of side quest.

This show has a great look to it and visually captures that 'used future' of the original Star Wars trilogy. But long arty shots of a helmeted man travelling from place to place (be it on sperm monster or not) does not make up for 2 episodes of next to no consequential narrative development or character exploration. Unfortunately what could have been quite a fun video game has not been adapted well enough to be a good TV show.

ukdean13 November 2019
A long time ago.....and oh my has it been a long time since we have watched anything concerned with Star Wars that captured our hearts and minds until this 1st episode.

Everyone had been worried we would get a total farce of a production, but everyone connected to this 1st showing deserves a slap on the back. Loved it. Totally loved it.

Throwing in Baby Yoda was genius. I truly hope every episode continues to follow up with this amazing start!

If you like Star Wars you are gonna love this The visuals are stunning, the show looks so good with its practical effects and the soundtrack is great, it fits the style of the show so nicely! It really feels like Star Wars and has that rogue one gritty feeling to it while capturing the essence of both the prequels and original trilogy, really enjoyed it. The mandalorian is a badass likeable dude The action is awesome and fun with a western vibe. I am very excited to see the next episodes!

Watched first episode. It alone was many levels better than any of the latest SW movies. Interesting story, great action scenes, memorable characters. No "weird space stuff" just for the sake of weird space stuff - everything was in it's place.

I really prefer hard SciFi and not a fan of SW, but even I liked this TV show. Looking forward to the next episodes.

Could have been a nice series...
midhuj-569163 December 2019
Mandalorian looks so small, though when I saw the first 3 chapters, I thought 'It will be ok'. But with the next one, my respect and faith is ruined... I started laughing when he got into a punch up with the woman. He's a hard core trained fighter wearing a metal helmet, yet this woman is able to punche him in the head .Ha! Hilarious. That's when I pressed stop. Meh! There seems to be a serious lack of good writers about nowadays. My advice to all the networks is..invest in writers first. No matter how good the effects, no matter how big the budget, if the writing is pants, the show will be pants. The Mandalorian COULD be the great TV series.

chip-225-7525791 January 2020
This is the first review I've written. As for this TV show - I am not impressed, not in any way, shape, or form. It is most certainly subpar for a Disney program. The mixed CGI, sometimes it well done, sometimes is not done well at all. The story has been nothing to get excited about. The music soundtrack sounds like it goes to some other shows and was patched into this one. It's awful. It often doesn't match what's happening in the show. I will say that I've never been a huge Star Wars fan. I saw all the original movies, lost interest in the later ones and haven't bothered watching any of them again. And the same will go for this show. Now I've seen all of the first season, and I most definitely will not be watching the second season. This looks like a B-grade show from a B-grade studio, but it's from Disney? How embarrassing for them.

A True Star Wars Story
mertysrsisman26 December 2019
I liked the fact that there was a different event in every part of the series. I was very excited to watch the adventures of the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda. If this continues, it will be a great success. One of the most important features of the series is the management of each part of the different directors. Watching a true star wars story makes me really happy. Part times are also very good

It could be Clint Eastwood under that helmet.
muttley196320 December 2019
To me this is the best Star Wars spin off by far. Great production with great one off stories within the overall tale. Mando is one cool dude with a side to him that surprised me but was heartwarming to see. Great characters, great stories and a great show. This is the wild west in a far far away galaxy. Long may it continue..

It's just okay
richney101013 December 2019
Not sure why all the 10 star reviews. After the first episode they all were just okay. The dialog is horrible. It's good enough to watch but nothing to write home about.

Just great fun.
medwards13 December 2019
I'll be honest, I am not the biggest Star Wars fan.

Don't get me wrong, I love the original three movies, but, to be honest, when I was a kid, I really rather preferred Indiana Jones for pure entertainment, and in terms of science fiction, I thought Star Trek was better.

The older I got, the more I came to love the original films, especially the Empire Strikes Back which is dark perfection. However, those memories have been repeatedly tainted by The Prequels, and more recently the new main series, and Han Solo, which was nice but without point from my perspective. The only thing I have really enjoyed apart from the original trilogy was Rogue One. I guess if you disagree with me, by this point, and are a massive fan or all of it, or those things I don't like, you will probably no longer care what I have to say.

This is quite simply brilliant. It captures the fun and the darkness of the original films, each episode is mercifully short in a time when TV series sometimes force us to watch hour and a half episodes, and so far everything in it has been spot on for me.

Yes, it is obvious it works almost exactly like a computer game (as I believe it was originally planned to be) and I guess some people could moan it is obvious what is going to happen, but there is a joy in watching it unfold that is unrivalled in most other modern TV.

There are some stellar performances (Werner Herzog oozing his unique brand of insane menance, Nick Nolte managing to make a CGI face still seemed grizzled by many, many years of existence, and the stuntwoman turned actor from Haywire, who has clearly honed her acting technique since that interesting but rough film) but the acting award needs to go to Pedro Pascal who manages to convey so much emotion and character despite wearing a silly helmet all the time and not speaking too much.

If, like me, you have always liked the original three films, but are not a massive fan of it all, and you are tired of the current slew of films, give this a go, I reckon like me, you will love it to bits.

This TV series is better than the last several movies
ablack902 December 2019
Agree with all the other reviewers that this tv series The Mandolarian has captured the essence of the original Star Wars shot in late 1970s. The baby Yoda is beyond adorable. Every episode he's cuter. Peach fuzz on his bald head, endlessly emotional eyes and his little robe omg. The Mandolarian is a cool tribe of warriors and our main character doesn't speak much but in the first episode we're already routing for him. I was so down after the last string of Star Wars films, this tv series restores my faith that this wonderful story lives on.

How can you get something so spot on?
jackryan-1375923 November 2019
This series is amazing, the relationship and love you develop for characters is out of this world! You learn so much from this series about the Star Wars saga and learn a lot about the culture of Bounty Hunters. 100% recommended even if you're not a Star Wars fan!

The greatest thing to happen to Star Wars
joshommon23 November 2019
I created an account just to write this. The Mandalorian is the best TV show out right now. The cinematography, acting, music and action is AMAZING. Star Wars fans have been waiting for a live action TV show and this was the best thing we could have hoped for. Do yourself a favor and watch this. Even a non Star Wars fan would get into this.

What? How? Am I hallucinating?
mj_alexf22 November 2019
This is beyond great. The atmosphere, the cinematography, the score are all on point. It is an original idea and it has been executed incredibly so far. I love it! Has an authentic Star Wars feeling, does a few but very smart things in terms of character development, and the overall presentation is magnificent. No over the top sequences, no over the top humor, and no shoehorned BS like the last couple of movies in the saga. Please, keep going in that direction. Thank you.

Absolutely stunner here
moink36922 November 2019
Each episode is a cinematic masterpiece!! What a time to be a Star Wars fan! Jon Favreau helped Marvel revive with Iron Man and now he is helping the Star Wars franchise too. Now I am eagerly waiting for Kevin Feige to take the mantle and deliver us some masterpieces in the near future. Disney+ is already changing the definition of tv-series with its big budget shows lining up.

Truly Outstanding Television
frozen-3257416 November 2019
What an amazing start to the series. I enjoy it more than the movies. It is filmed like a movie with exceptionally beautiful shots, stunning CGI, and breathtaking action sequences

The story is really enjoyable and also easy to follow along. Disney has hit it out of the park with this one.

Have not seen any worse series
zakarias-nagy16 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
It is like I'm watching a a printed cartoon. Only difference is that the pictures are moving. The dialogues feels like nothing, they could write the sentences in bubbles wouldnt change anything at all. There is no motivation, there is no real characteristics of any character, there is no background, there is no logic, there is no story behind any. As for star wars this is a terrible idea again. Little Yoda? are u fckn kidding me? or what is that.... Disney are making fun again of star wars. They'd better stop streaming this like right now.

Honestly I think this is terrible in all the ways.

So well crafted, so entertaining
cherold15 December 2019
There are a lot of impressive things about The Mandalorian, but what I love the most is the way it introduces fully three-dimensional characters with detailed backstories that are only hinted at in every episode, even though some are one-ofs and others only show up intermittently.

That guy in the first episode who kept saying "I have spoken," the love interest on that peaceful planet, that over-the-top knife thrower who knew Mando back in the day. You could spin any of them into a season's worth of episodes, but instead they're here and gone in a flash.

That's how much work goes into each episode. This is detailed world, and yes, this world has been being built for decades which gives the series an advantage, but then, humans have been around for centuries and there are still lots of series with sketched-out characters.

Also, first rate special effects, lots of exciting action, cool robots, mysterious hero with a personal code of honor that has a lot of gray areas, super cute critter with strange powers ... it's just all so good.

If you like Star Wars, you definitely need to watch this. If you don't, watch it anyway, just to admire it's commitment to fleshing out its guest characters.

Eli_Elvis15 November 2019
This is what happens when you don't have idiots in charge! Iger should Fire Kathleen Kennedy, retcon 7, 8, 9 and immediately hire Filoni and Favrau to redo the obscenity which is 7, 8, & most probably 9. I have zero interest in 9 under Kennedy and Jar Jar's direction and Rian should be thrown in a sarlac pit.

Engaging, visually stunning and full of mystery.
brofiteroles14 November 2019
I don't wanna be 'that guy', but I never write reviews. I've had an account on here years and I must have written about 5 reviews, this will be one of those times.

I've never considered myself a massive Star Wars fan but I became more engaged from episode 6 onwards, the films were great - but this first episode was incredible. It drew my in from the start and I supposed it helped that I didn't really know about the Mandalorian, so the mystery was more intense. If I say anything else I'll probably have to add the spoiler warning into it. Can't wait for episode 2!

It wasn't over-hyped
bigsarge-3748813 November 2019
I was excited to see the new Star Wars spin off. Thankfully it wasn't over hyped like Hollywood does sometimes. It delivered on every level for (me). The guest appearances was a pleasant surprise for me as well (John Beasley, Carl Weathers) I didn't do a lot of YouTube and Google searching to see what was coming and I'm glad I didn't.

Great job Jon!

I don't understand
billylilly7619 December 2019
Ok. I have been a star wars fan since I watched Empire Strikes Back in the theater as a kid. I have watched all the movies, TV shows, cartoons had the toys. I do not understand the hype on this show. Let's take out baby Yoda sorry the child. This show is TERRIBLE!. He is this supposedly trained killer, but he always gets his back kicked the fight sequences are short and lame. Lets destroy an AT-ST by getting it to fall into a hole. The actors are HORRIBLE . Take Yoda out of it and there is nothing good about this

I'm literally only watching it to see Bill Burr in that one episode. Holy crap is this show awful. Corny writing, pointless quests, baffoonery and just my god, terrible. Without baby Yoda this show would've tanked.

Where is the STORY?
atlantisz-27 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
1st Part was OK, full with hope and one of the biggest cliffhanger I'd ever seen. 2nd Part made me sad. A Hollywood panel (kids and dogs) baby Yoda and the EGG...What was this? Why was this egg so speciel? No answer (so far). 3rd Part...What is the motivation of this complet turn? 4th Part was Kurosawa "Seven samurais"..or the American version "Magnificent seven". Any original idea???

C'mon Favreau, don't be lazy! You are far better than this.

Favreau resurrects Star Wars
mtyducs14 November 2019
I can not believe it. A solid Star Wars segment and the first good anything since episode VI. I am dying to see how this season plays out. Favreau brought Star Wars back to the basics....removing the the childish aspect that the movies increasingly had. It is a clean story line with every scene shot on amazing backdrops.

But what sets this apart from the last 10 or whatever movies....IS THE CHARACTERS AND THE ACTORS WHO PLAY THEM that make the show so good. Like Apollo Creed...hope to see more of him. And Mando of course....he has the best one liners ever.

Who would have thought someone from the Swingers crew would save Star Wars?

After 5 episodes, I can now say 3 things:

1. Favreau is a genuis 2. Mando is greatest character is Star Wars universe 3. The kid is the 2nd greatest character in the Star Wars universe

A better Star Wars
adamstamp13 November 2019
This is everything that Star Wars was, and should be. If Star War was given modern technology and the experience aculmulated since it was first created, this is the series that would be an expression of that. I currently believe this could be the best TV series ever if episode 1 is anything to go by. However I will add I am a massive Star Wars fan and the lore and history of Mandalorians is my favourite part of that.

The Ultimate western in space. Tence, gritty, dark, hilarious and incredibly cool. The most fun you can have out of Beskar'gam.

So far, AWESOME
aguynameddrew13 November 2019
I've only seen the first episode but it's great and i'm hooked. I hope the rest of the series maintains the quality of this first one.

The production value and set design is top notch. The Mandalorian is a stoic hero-esque character. The supporting cast of aliens are rough around the edges believable, and thankfully NO jar jar binks types (at least so far).

I read a few reviews, all of them great, but none that i read mentioned Jon Favreau. He wrote, directed, and produced this series and he deserves more shout outs for this awesome creation.

I am a Mandalorian addict and i need MORE!

davidkippy13 November 2019
The first episode was a predictable but entertaining start to the series, exactly what it needed to be. I'm excited for the next episode (but not as hyped for Episode 9). People who over-hyped the ending may be underwhelmed at what it actually is.

A good fanmovie... Wait, it isn't fanmade? :O
sgtGiggsy20 November 2019
Seriously. Don't fall the hype from fanboys who just want to praise anything that doesn't have Rey in it. This series is garbage so far. The protagonist doesn't have personality at all. He spends almost every second on screen, yet he showed no signs of personality. The dialogues are either borrowed from give-or-take two-thousand other movies, or ridiculously bad. The action sequences belong to a fanmovie, because they completely lack sense, or dynamism. Even the CGI was lackluster for a Star Wars product. I'll keep watching, but only because it's Star Wars. If it was an original show with no connection to a universe I love, I would've stopped watching it after the first episode.

Yes, It's a nice storyline. But it's a very very slow burning story with many little ventures without any meaning for the whole storyline. I think I'll skip season 2

Lacks direction
Krawia29 January 2020
Baby Yoda is nice and all that but this show could be so much more if it had any direction. Having 2-3 episodes to explore characters and the world without moving the plot forward isn't necessary a bad thing but when more than half the show is essentially filler episodes it loses so much of its potential. Show could be amazing by exploring Mandalore after the Clone Wars.

This is what you should be watching
kuashie22 January 2020
I used one sitting to watch this entire series and I have to say it one of my best time spent at a series. It really deserves the 10/10.

This series is so well met that it does not carry any unwanted chaff or heavy baggage. The acting is good, the plot is solid moving from one sequence to another.

All major characters takes their role seriously and play it to the latter, unlike other silly series out there.

Season one was super. Although I know there are a few flaws here and there that would be worked on in season 2.

My advice is everyone give this slice of life show a chance and they would not regret time, energy and money spent watching.

blazaroo21 January 2020
Words can't describe how beautiful and perfect this series is. The nostalgic feel of each episode is what makes this series a perfect addition to the Star Wars franchise. I really felt like a little boy again. John Favreau has shown the whole world that he is capable of taking Star Wars to another level. And the best part about it is, he's just getting started. He has definitely brought balance to Star Wars. I HAVE SPOKEN

I give the Adventures of Mando and Baby Yoda a 9. Thoroughly enjoyed the short, fast paced episodes and definite throw backs to classic westerns. Giving it a 9 because a couple episodes in the middle of the season just didn't do it for me.. but overall some of the best TV and Star Wars I've seen in a long time.

Fresh and interesting story, can't wait for the next season
cica-papagaj199814 January 2020
Amidst fiasco that are sequels we move away from Skywalkers and their problems to experience something new. We follow entirely new characters in time between originals and novelty. It's a story that doesn't relly on nostalgia, it doesn't show you slightly familiar scenes and expects you to squeal in delight. It shows you how things can change. It also shows you the badass Mandalorian we waited for along with some very strong friends. I was entertained, I laughed, gasped and shed a tear. Lasers, ships, droids, fights, warriors in s p a c e. Also baby yoda. What more could you ask for?

This is good. This is really good.
reid-5496112 January 2020
The full season one of the Mandalorian is on Disney+ and when I watched the trailers I KNEW I needed to see this. This is Star Wars' first venture into a live-action, episodic series.. and it works. It just works. It captures all of the great moments that the Star Wars franchise is known for while still staying fresh and authentic. For a show that revolves around a character that has a code to never remove his helmet, the writers and directors do a great job of inducing emotion. It makes it a great example of the "show, don't tell" direction in storytelling. The writing is great and I was really able to immerse myself into these characters and the time they were in. Speaking of, this specific time in the Star Wars timeline hasn't truly been explored and definitely not in this way, making it a great peak of interest to those well-versed in the franchise. But I think one of the best parts is that you don't *have* to be well-versed. You don't *have* to know every Easter Egg or reference or species in this series. If you know nothing at all about Star Wars, you will still have an amazing time. Couple the unforgettable soundtrack and the obvious, but well done, western feel to it, and you get something special. It meant a lot to be able to sit back and get immersed in this show especially after all the controversy and side-taking that was Rise of Skywalker. This is good. This is really really good. 9/10.

bluenine-212 January 2020
Good storytelling, great characters, and the exact star wars universe. The best thing to come out of Lucasfilms since the Return of the Jedi. Finally something that feels like a continuation of that story.

This is the way!
mckaymalcolm12 January 2020
I remember fondly, I saw the original Star Wars in the UK twice for my eighth birthday back in 1978, then subsequently the next two. After many years, I then remember the excitement in the 1990s, then the 2010's that Star Wars was returning - only for me to witness someone else's 'version' of what Star Wars was- and it was horrific. So much so that about 5 years ago I swore never to watch any Disney made Star Wars film ever- and I've genuinely not seen the last 3. However, as this TV show was more accessible, and I wasn't 'paying' for it - the reviews piqued my interest - so I took a a quick peep - and was immediately hooked. I recognised this universe- it was so familiar to me - and I hadn't had that feeling for a 'long long time'. The main story and subplots fit perfectly- and, of course, that Star Wars humour that's been so badly missing was back. If I'm being really picky - a couple of British accents would seal the whole feel, remember the original was filmed in the UK with many British actors involved. I've binged 5 episodes so far with 3 to go. For many years I've felt ashamed to even be associated with Star Wars given how Disney in particular has ruined and commercialized the franchise beyond recognition; however, this has changed everything. I will still never pay to go see a Star Wars movie - I suspect that there will be many hideous scripts waiting to be added to the carnage that Disney has created - but if this is the standard of their Star Wars tv arm - then sign me up! As the Mandalorian says 'This is the way!' - and he's absolutely right.

Star Wars excellence
erikvanstraaten11 January 2020
Great season one and I look forward to seeing more. The first two episodes blew me away because of the atmosphere, beautiful shots and storyline. I was hoping for grand final episode, which was more mediocre and sadly enough looked and felt more processed like the last cinema trilogy. The music is excellent too, the opera continues!

Feels like original Star Wars, only without the lightsabers
bogdanbalostin10 January 2020
Honestly, the story is too simple for my taste with a lot of screen time relying on action choreography and beautiful cinematography. The dialogue is simple and straight to the point, the moments of silence long. It's like someone actually knew how to take advantage of the visual medium of cinema (only we're talking here about the small screen).

So I couldn't help but marvel at how well-put-together this show looks like.

Compared to any other series out there right now, this is completely different. Even sometimes boring (if I compare). But it works. It has the charms, the characters and the heart to carry the story forward, no matter how simple this story is.

And everything works.

Like the original Star Wars which took the hero journey and illustrated it without skipping any steps, this one is respecting the formula with great attention to detail at every step.

One of the best shows I have seen in awhile
strassermarlies1 January 2020
I normally don't review much on this site, but after watching "The Witcher" and seeing how many people rated that show with a 10 when objectively speaking it was pretty bad -- I feel the need to support a GOOD TV show. The Mandalorian is a good show with good character, good dialogues, an engaging plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE. I'm not a Star Wars fan, I think I watched two or three movies but could never get into it. But I'm a sucker for Space Western like Cowboy Bebop, Firefly, Killjoys etc. and this is the same genre. The world is incredible, the custumes and CGI are great, the character are lovable and it's NOT overly sexual. You have a guy who forms a friendship with a female soldier without having to sleep with her after one episode. This was such a solid and enjoyable TV show. Whoever is behind this, is very talented. Normally I would give it a 8.5 or a 9, but I will give it a 10, just to show my support. I hope we'll get many more series like this in the future. And I'm not necessarily taking about the genre, I'm talking about a good script, charismatic actors, smart plot and dialogues.

THIS is the way
Meousman30 December 2019
The whole theme of this series is the Star Wars I loved! Even though I was mostly entertained by episode IX, I was pretty dissapointed with the plot holes and the saga's poor overall story telling so it's nice to be given this fresh new story and one that will return next autumn.

The characters are exciting and have actual meaning, for example every time Kulil said 'I have spoken', even though after he said it a couple of times and it was like some weird catch phrase it always fit well with the dialouge and would subtly represent the trust of the characters.

The only con of the series would have to be the episode length. They could definetely be longer, but after seeing numerous reviews also saying this I trust they will take it onboard.

After reading a lot of people saying that the series had a decline on chapter 4 and 5, to anyone thinking of starting the series I would say don't read into it, personally I thought chapter 4: Sanctuary was probably my favourite episode and following just as good as any other.

Hats of to Mr Favreau, he truly has revived all hope for brighter future in this beautiful universe!

Best show i've ever watched
agiutudor30 December 2019
This feels like Star Wars and has an amazing story with super special effects. Yet somehow there are still some weird fat chads that say this is very bad. Why tho? I don't know, but i will never regret watching this amazing show.

Home run for Disney. Everyone loves it. Friends and guests that come over want to watch the show and love it. Ended up watching every episode at least three or more times, never get tired of seeing them. It is one of the shows we enjoy watching over and over. Thanks, Disney!

Best Star Wars addition in years
Rushiera29 December 2019
Someone called it live-action cartoon, my initial reaction was "yeah thats what we wanted".

The reason i gave it 10?. It paces itself. It has good characters. Resonance and verisimilitude is there, which is essential for anything that is to be categorized "good". The Mandalorian takes a very simple premise "the life of a mandalorian through his routine day job that is bounty hunting" and it opens us to the entire Star Wars Universe. This is good stuff be sure to check it out.

This show has everything you want in a Star Wars universe!
jvendetta29 December 2019
This show is amazing. The writing and acting is perfect. The casting was done so well. The story is what every Star Wars fan needed... not the same story you've been following since the original trilogy. They finally decided to explore the rich universe Star Wars offered and they nailed it. You don't need to watch any other star wars movie to get this, but it's filled with Easter eggs for those that have. The humor is very good. It's not corny or childish like all the movies. The Emotion is there, and there is no lame love story to fill up too much space. And the action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. The season finale? I'm not gonna give a spoiler but that episode is my favorite piece of film, more than any other movie or tv show, Star Wars or anything else. Best show you could watch hands down. It's perfect.

Star Wars Done Right
salinaqvi28 December 2019
In an age of uncertainty in Disneys Star Wars, The Mandalorian is a welcomed and fresh surprise. Everything about this series screams Star Wars and it is fantastic. From the mysterious characters to the settings to of course the star Baby Yoda, this is a must see series for everyone including non Star Wars fans. However the main problem in the series are the unnecessary filler which dont further the story or even develop its central characters that much. But when the story is put front and centre, this becomes a marvel to watch at. A must see.

shatteredsoulsrp30 November 2019
This show is by far one of the best star wars themed shows I've seen, and even one of the best shows in general. Every episode grabs you by the heart. I recommend this show to literally everyone. This show alone is worth the sub money.

tytahiti30 November 2019
Great writting and directing. Mixes StarWars with Western classics such as the good the bad and the ugly. I lost love for the franchise due to the recent films but this TV series has resurrected a passion I thought I'd never have again for Star Wars. Highly recommend!

What the new Star Wars should be
thomasrader1029 November 2019
The feel and shots of this film doesn't only make this a great Star Wars show but just great In general. There is a lot of great lore and good relationships and development, which is way better than the feminism that Disney thinks just solves movie problems nowadays.

Decent Star Wars Again
liche-129 November 2019
I like this. It's not perfect, but it's obvious that it's put together by people who understand what Star Wars is supposed to be (unlike those who gave us The Last Jedi).

I have spoken!
deibid-6992128 November 2019
FINALLY Star Wars. Thank you Jon Favreau, this is exactly what we were expecting to see ever again. To be honest I had lost all hopes after walking out dishearted from Solo and avoiding TLJ like the plague. But I have recovered those chills down my spine that I last felt watching Rogue One in the cinema. YES.

The grand scenes, the imaginative world building, the concise and very informative setting... SEE JJ and Rian... it was not THAT hard to setup the universe in a meaningful way. You drop a couple of explanations here and there and you are done. Easter eggs and references galore... The action... oh man the action! the music! the effects! the acting...with helmet ON!!! kudos to Pedro, I never imagined that a bounty hunter in full armor could be so expresive: body language well used. Just reminded me how expresive Darth Vader was in Return of the Jedi.

There is only one downside: the sequel trilogy has already ruined the lore, and I am VERY afraid that this series will have to link to it in more than one way. Moreover, if I think about the wider Galaxy context then it diminishes the great in-universe story that is unfolding in the series, like it happened in the 4th episode, which screwed up all the perfect setup of the first 3, totally disneyfied. It does feel completely detached, pointless, does not bring anything new and the worldbuilding goes totally off track. Hiring so different directors is a flaw.. and hiring Ron Howards daughter a bigger one.

Apart from that single episode that I will skip in subsequent viewings, the rest of the season is almost flawless and the great two last episodes retake the plot setup in the initial three and ends with a bang that leaves me eager to continue in season 2!

A western in Space
jashminocha28 November 2019
Imagine Western in space -- what is what this latest creation is A Western in Space. It's mesmerizing, hands down one of the best series in the star wars saga. With brilliant visual effects, masterful tension building scenes and near perfect acting delivered by Pedro Pascal, the series will take your breath away. Jon favero is a master, who builds remarkable on extraordinary talent on screen. hands down... this is the best contribution to the star wars saga in a long time

The Mandalorian = Season 1 Episode 3
chema-6503124 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The third episode is by far the best.

We find more insights into "Mando's" past as a child. I found this fascinating & I feel there is much more to come. These flashbacks are significant to where the plot & story will go with the Mando character.

I find the Mando character so fascinating. The way Mando keeps thinking about the kid after it saved his life. It is this that has triggered those old memories. The fact Mando sacrifices a new job to go back to see what happened to the kid confirms his conflicting personalities with been a true bounty hunter & having some humanity. I for one love this aspect of the Mando character.

The fact he goes back to save the kid may be seen as flaw in the bounty hunter code but I find it fascinating as to where this will lead him. Seeing those stormtroopers confirmed that remnants of the empire are very much alive though they may themselves be mercenaries. The leftovers of a once proud empire army. The fact Mando wipes them all out & saves the kid will no doubt lead to a greater conflict.

This is confirmed when Greef Karga & his henchmen try to stop him taking the kid. I want to know why saving the kid is so important to Mando. Perhaps the kid reminds him of himself when he was a child and was taken form his family? By the empire?

There is a massive shoot out between Mando's fellow Mandalorian brothers & Karga's henchmen. When Karga tries to stop Mando in his ship, the "code" been broken confirms my suspicion of Mando's conflicting loyalties. Great plot innovation.

It was fascinating to see the underground bunkers where other Mandalorian's live & how they keep adding features to their armoury from the payments they receive. This is a true reflection on what they are as a subset species.

Cannot wait to see where The Mandalorian goes to from now in terms of plot. Where is Mando taking the kid, Why? With what purpose? All will be revealed & we are been taken on magical, mystical journey of right & wrong in true Star Wars fashion.

I love where this show is going.

Ignore all hurt Star Trek fans 1 Star reviews
mastiff-man24 November 2019
It was great. Look if there is one thing I can't stand it's one fan base downranking another fan bases films, tv show etc; just because they are such losers. I am not a Trekkie or massive Star Wars fan. But I just watch all three of the first episodes with my wife and we both thoroughly enjoyed it so far. 10/10 just to skew the horrible 1 Star ranks. Probably is still a 9/10. I honestly like the material we've been given so far

Rammelasen24 November 2019
Jon Favreau brings Star Wars back to Star Wars. He understands the core of the sagas storytelling and the simplicity of the concept. Listen up JJ Abrams and most of all Rian Jonsson; this is Star Wars. And @kathleenkennedy why oh why did you put these big Hollowyood directors in charge of an epos. Favreau and his team could have and would have done it so much better.

Favreau just gave life to a different part of the galaxy and creates a story that in every second honours the dna of Stars Wars. Hat is off!

kenstallings-6534622 November 2019
The first in what appears to be a series of original live action Star Wars series on the new Disney+ web subscription service, The Mandalorian is offering up superior quality entertainment.

Outstanding scripts, superb acting, and a theme that reveals the ultimate in honorable warrior ethos, The Mandalorian reveals the essence of the martial code of life.

Added are excellent musical scores combined with a main theme title that is distinctive and memorable. In truth, this series has everything going for it.

charlieedmond17 November 2019
Seriously, The Mandalorian should've been given the budget of the trilogy. It has a absolutely fresh take on anything you can stream these days and that fresh take feels like a welcomed sigh of relief in today's saturated market. I place it in line with The Boys for upcoming shows to make a mark. 10/10

"The Mandalorian" is just "Meh" - another movie adaptation that has nothing more to offer than nostalgia.
Jaggerjaque16 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I don't really understand why people are rating those series that high. I mean alright, I am being nostalgic about the whole Star Wars universe myself, but is this enough for us to give it a 9/10 score. I don't think so. What we've seen so far (two episodes into the series) is a man on bounty quest and a surprising finding, all happening in the context of the first star wars trilogy, that we all love so much. What is more, the length of each episode is not long enough - I mean, come on - 30 minutes? Is this a sitcom comedy or a serious Star Wars take? Hopefully they are going to give us something mind-blowing going deep in the universe, don't know, but so far "The Mandalorian" is just "Meh" - another movie adaptation that has nothing more to offer than nostalgia.

A PERFECT STAR WARS.
raykuanlabel-291-47341014 November 2019
From the unpolished costumes / NO shiny-clean policy including the set design is authentic George Lucas aesthetic and logic. The Mandalorian is the real Star Wars after George Lucas' last Star Wars movie. Even the pacing of the episode is spot on. I luv that the episode is not rushed - makes me crave for more. Also, we now finally found the new Harrison Ford in Pedro Pascal which the current Star Wars trilogy could never match. There is hope after all.

First episode is quite good
acedj13 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Disney gives us a series about an elite tribe, the Mandalorians. The first and only episode on Disney + so far was quite well done. It lacks some of the production value of the movies, but none if the heart. The first episode introduces us the the main character, who is unnamed. At the beginning on the episode he is searching for a mark. Once found he escorts the prisoner to what could only be known as a bookie for bounty hunters. This leads him to a meeting with what remains of the empire, I am given to believe that this takes place after Return of the Jedi. From this meeting he is given a new bounty to hunt down and he meets up with some interesting characters along the way. There is plenty of action in this episode as well. Great job this far Disney.

Worse than Solo, a Star Wars story
kinsella5512 November 2019
An even bigger disappointment than Solo, a Star Wars story. It starts as a fan-made short movie and stays that way. Actually I've seen better fan-made videos on youtube than this. It was painful to watch. The alien creatures look bad, to say the least, the story is....... Well actually there isn't any. It starts with shooting and that doesn't stop in this episode. The Mandalorian sounds like Clint Eastwood and that gimmick is completely out of place. Younger Star Wars fans might love this with all their shooting games, but the fans of the 20th century will hate it. Even Jar Jar Binks was a better character than this bunch of amateurs. Except for Werner Herzog, who is convincing as a client of the Mandalorian.

A Good Start.
type-a1pha3 February 2020
The Mandalorian is a good enough series with interesting characters and excellent world-building. Given the recent Star Wars installments, it is a huge improvement. It lacks a bit in the story department given that it is a weekly monster format and the characters are mostly one-dimensional. But overall it is an enjoyable adventure, with immersive scenery and great cinematography. Fans of this cinematic universe will definitely appreciate the effort. Hopefully the next season will provide a deeper narrative and more elaborate characters.

joejasso-70-3992611 February 2020
A simplistic story is the base for a great show. The production value is amazing! While the pace of the show is slow at first, it is necessary to set up the solitary life of a bounty hunter. It is this loneliness that makes the relationships he builds so much more meaningful. A worthy installment to Star Wars cannon.

Haider-198431 January 2020
The Mandalorian exceeded all of my expectations. Fantastic performances from all the actors, and choc full of breathtaking action. There may not be any jedi or as much lightsabers, but still, this is still Star Wars, but in an epic take "From a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away".

Disney's best
theprododo28 January 2020
I liked the mandalorian so much that I can't wait for season 2. I also loved the music of Ludwig Göransson. And of course the cute baby yoda. The best episode is the last one made by director Taika Waititi who also made Thor ragnarok his humor is just amazing. The special effects looked great for a show. I recommend the show to everyone But then you do have to subscribe to disney + but luckily it's a lot cheaper than netflix.

Cool, gritty, western feel
jeff-8917728 January 2020
I've only watched 3 episodes so far, and I am enjoying it. The acting is good, the story is simple but interesting. If I can give any criticism, it's the music. If it stands out and makes you notice, much of the time, that's not a good thing. The music is like John Williams light mixed with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly soundtrack mixed with any TV show in the 70's. I'm trying to put it out of my mind when I'm watching, but it's hard. Other than that, it's an entertaining show, bringing me back to the old Star Wars movies.

Visually 10/10. But...
niclasjoh20 January 2020
I love The real star wars feel, the world, all creatures, Mando and his style, and The sound aswell from speeders to even just background music and noices. It gives you The real star wars feel.

The story is okay, But why it gets an 7/10 is because The balance in The character/story building is weird, feels like The show is missing alot of story of some character But meanwhile some "unimportant" charaters/events that wouldent even make an diffrence in The end got a more devolept story? So The writing is sometimes just aint gonna cut it.

Old fashioned, watchable popcorn TV
anthony-burton17 January 2020
The Mandalorian is a decent TV show, but it's not mind blowing and I struggle to think how they are going to make it more appealing. Outside of the Mandalorian and baby Yoda, there are no recurring characters in the show. Which means there's no one to root for, no one to root against, it's very old fashioned in fact, with each episode being rather self contained and very little carrying over. So whilst the universe it's set in remains as fascinating as ever, the show itself is rather shallow and unsatisfying. Still, leave your brain at the door, keep your expectations low, and there's enough here to pass a few hours of time and be reasonably entertained in the process.

Not for modern sensitivities
trantor2nd9 January 2020
I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan, but I don't hate any of the movies. For the high production cost and acclaim this series is getting, I cannot stomach the typical tropes of the Star Wars films where Storm Troopers are bumbling idiots, laser blasters are less accurate and effective than bullets, and many characters act irrationally or comically. Why would two bike troopers holding a much-fought/killed over bounty prize feel relaxed and jest with a bounty hunter droid who approached them through a large expanse of empty dessert when they know for a fact that their light weapons are ineffective against such killer droids? Such poor writing occurs every episode. Spaghetti westerns might be interesting to some children nowadays, but I think only die-hard Star Wars fans would truly enjoy this one.

Wagon train to the stars
ahavaipod9 January 2020
Formulaic Western in space, but not as appealing as original Star Trek,which is why Star Trek vs. Star Wars was a thing.

Why must every scene be so dark? Do you mind if I see the action?

And is Star Lord missed they are blatantly stealing from his story?

But it's the IT show, so I feel compelled to watch it when Season Two comes out in 2027 ...

Bring on Season 2 & onwards
chema-6503130 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Then final episode of The Mandalorian begins with what I was expecting to see. The evolution of a child Mando, who's real name we find is Din Djarin. We also see how he was saved by a battalion of Mandalorian's when his tribe & entire family are killed. I had been waiting for this since episode 1. This perfectly sets up Season 2 & where this plot evolution will go. I wanted to start with this as it sets up how amazing this show can be in ensuing seasons.

We see how The Mandalorian's save Din Djarin in a massive battle against empire clone robot troops. This is very well portrayed. I want to see more explanation of this story.

But we at least see that The Mandalorian tribe saves him & raised him in the fighting corps as one of there own. There is so much more we can learn from this.

The introduction of a Moff Gideon has also added so much narrative to the plot. No doubt this character will be an ongoing main antagonist. The actor they chose to play him is perfect. Giancarlo Esposito is superb in this role. He is such a gifted actor & this role suits him like a glove.

Din suggests escaping to the sewage tunnels where The Mandalorian's live to escape Moff Gideon & his troops.

The IG-11 unit plays a special role in the final episode. He saves Din, Cara Dune & Greef Karga when they are attacked by Moff Gideon's troops. He really has taken to heart the orders to keep The Kid safe. I really like this character. I like the dialogue between Din & IG-11 when Din is dying after he is taken out by Moff Gideon. It is at this stage, and only stage that we see the real face Din Djarin. Revealing to us that he is a real person, not just a cyborg. This adds a depth of humanity to his character, which I really enjoyed. Great writing. IG-11 saves Din. I found this profound given Din's distrust of IG units in general. This will be showcased in greater detail later in the episode.

Armorer makes an appearance to clean up all the dead Mandalorian units that have been killed by Moff Gideon's troops. This is a critical dialogue as we finally learn that The Kid is a Jedi - we know him as Yoda. Armorer does some some fine work in taking out several stormtroopers while Din, Cara, Greef & IG-11 escape.

They find a boat and row in molten larva to escape. This was amazing scenery, especially when IG-11 tells them to be careful as they are surrounded by molten larva. It is during this journey that IG-11 sacrifices himself when they come upon a large number of stormtroopers. The dialogue between Din & IG-11 is emotional, IG detects Din will miss him even though he won't admit to it, though he does say that they need him. In any case, IG-11 walks though the molten larva & auto-destructs killing all the waiting stormtroopers.

Moff Gideon attacks as they exit the sewage tunnels in a tie fighter. Din takes him out with a fine aerial attack. Is Moff dead? That easily?

Din then leaves with Baby Yoda. I found it a nice touch that he buries Kuiil - I have spoken. Another character I really liked.

To conclude the episode, we see Moff Gideon exiting the crashed tie fighter. No doubt my hypothesis that he will be an ongoing antagonist will be explored in ensuing seasons. He is a dark character to be sure.

The final episode of The Mandalorian was by far the best and sets up fascinating stories & plots in ensuing seasons. I really don't agree with a lot of the negative reviews. This show is dynamic, innovative & original. I look forward to continuing the journey of self discovery with Din & the ensuing plots created.

Bring on Season 2

Excellent; for the first time in years Star Wars feels like it's returned to form
mcsharpe-1351530 December 2019
What can I say, this show is terrific. This is how you do Star Wars. John and Dave know what exactly what they are doing and they are the future of Star Wars. They understand what Star Wars really is meant to be. The acting, story, action, and heart of this show is superb. This is how you tell a story. Disney....take notes.

Another wonderful addition to Star Wars canon
avgiantsfan9430 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Just as a preface, I've noticed a number of people have used their opportunity to praise this show as a way to also knock what Star Wars has been under Disney's ownership of Lucasfilm. Rather than spew another piece like, "now THIS is Star Wars", I'd prefer to share additional praise towards the content this show is in company with. Whether it's the films of the sequel trilogy or the animated shows, as a lifelong Star Wars I've adored the many stories that have been and are now being told in a galaxy far, far away. I think all of it has not only wonderfully honored what's come before, but continues to expand in awesome and surprising ways that remain true to the heart of the series.

The Mandalorian is no exception. What I love most in Star Wars is seeing as much of this fantastic galaxy as possible and meeting new interesting characters, both of which Mando has done in so many cool ways. The Child has certainly been the adorable scene stealer of this show and the Mandalorian himself has a curious backstory, but I've also loved seeing and learning more about characters like Cara Dune and Kuiil who all bring great personality to the show.

Another hallmark of Star Wars that Mando nails is the delicate yet effective balance between humor and drama. Favreau, Filoni, and everyone else involved with creating this show have really captured that joyous dyad (thanks TROS for teaching me that new word) and it succeeds in major part to that. But lots of praise has to also go to the overall excellent writing, music, digital and practical effects, cinematography, makeup, costumes, and sets. There's so much talent from all departments and it all combines to make this galaxy as truly fantastic as ever.

There's only a couple of minor complaints I have with this series; these include some of the musical pieces, pacing of certain episodes, and killing off interesting characters I wished to see more of such as Fennec Shand. These are minimal gripes, as the show as a whole is executed in stellar fashion. I'm also happy this show has introduced to a lot of people how awesome storytelling in Star Wars has also been outside of the films, and I cannot wait to see what more is in store for this show.

Very good. Worth the watch
gbrezina201530 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I like this much ore than I thought I would. It has a solid theme and story arc and although some episodes were just ok, most were good and interesting. A friend said he liked it because it doesn't try to do too much and depart to much from the original Star Wars style. I would agree; completely different story and yet similar in some way. It adds to the -verse, doesn't take away from it.

Visceral and full of heart - now am Star Wars fan
Blksummrstorm29 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Not that I wasn't a "Star Wars fan". Who isn't? Star Wars is part of our culture. But I was a "modest" SW fan - certainly didn't have the raging emotions about it some fans have. Probably coz it was, yah know, SPACE. And my attention was kinda taken up with Middle Earth and more fantasy-type stuff like Witcher etc.

Heck, I only signed up for Disney Plus to see Mandalorian as kind of a filler, waiting for the MCU series. Why not? More stuff to watch. It's not like I was a Boba Fett fan either - far as I know he was kind of a dubious character (or maybe that's his dad) who was being digested. I had to read up on why Boba is something of a thing.

But, this series had me hooked from the first cold, icy frames. Holy ^%$#!! (I'd say overall, it doesn't at times have the polished sheen re the occasional performance, or the lavish blockbuster movie treatment).

But. Across the board, the new hero, for one thing, is a breath of fresh air. Neither handsomely cocky or just plain savage, IMO Pablo Pascal and John Favreau bring layers of complexity to Din Djarin - just LOVE this guy. He's badass. He's a man of honor. He has a sense of humor. He gets beat. He has compassion. Din Djarin (how cool a name is that?) is quick thinking, fearless, dry humor, capable of tenderness, can be ruthless, all under the ominous helmet. He's the real deal, with past trauma haunting him. When he slammed that stick back in the Razor Crest and went for baby Episode 3, I was cheering.

That scene, and others, lead me to another thing I love about this series - characters and moments are given time to breath. Moments build to a crescendo, like the spectacular Season 8 scene of Baby standing against the fireball, and u see reflected flame fill the glass of Mando's helmet. Sweeping vistas - or that lonely shot of hurt Mando fixing his armor, out on the plains. Just the close-in shots of Mando flicking switches off IMO makes everything more REAL - like you could reach out and touch the interior of the ship. Scenes have texture, like the little hairs on the blurrgs, and firelight shining in Baby's eyes. Someone on set CARES about what they are crafting, visually.

Plus the introduced companions - from the moving performances of Nick Nolte and Taika Waititi as IG-11, to the ominous Client, to the glorious, unapologetic badass Cara Dune, to the mysterious Armourer/Clan Leader. The not overly-wordy script says just what needs to be said, no more, no less. IMO the editing is so well done here as well - like there's a beat, and a bang, and IG is down after pointing a blaster at Baby. IMO nothing more needed to be done in that scene. The cast is on board as well - like there's a scene in episode 8 where Greef, Cara, and Mando all pull their blasters at the right moment - because, for real, that's what they SHOULD do as characters.

Humor is done the RIGHT way, and it's not forced. LOL Greef tossing a few down when trapped by the Stormtroopers. IMO u see an an already great cast really coming together re chemistry, which makes me really CARE about these characters. Delightfully, u never know what this series is gonna do next - but all of it is done with obvious care, lots of nods to the SW universe - while staying its own pure thing. (And I am happy to see Favreau gently ease the audience into what-does-Mando-look-like-under-the-helmet, without making a big deal about it. Sure the helmet is cool, there's the code, but as Season 2 gets underway *realistically* I think folks need to see Din Djarin's face once in a while. Not that Pablo Pascal isn't doing stellar voice work).

Finally, IMO simply magnificent music - alternatively haunting, tribal, tender, violent, and triumphant. And, of course, Baby Yoda. From an archetype/myth standpoint, the warrior who swears to protect a sacred child. It's been done before in films, but here IMO is handled with incredible skill and a flowing naturalness, as this hardened Hunter falls to the charms of Baby. Well, he's a good man. And a good man wouldn't have stood a chance against Baby LOL. I know I got pretty upset Episode 8 beginning, and glad the Internet is enraged over the punching of Baby (:

Biggest flaw? I want more. I wanna move to Navarro or Sorgan and hang out and eat kabobs and swill spotchka. It's pure joy being around to see a new icon arrive in the media world. Feels good to care again after the GOT end debacle.

michaja-kravanja29 December 2019
Well for a Star Wars series and a Disney venture I expected a bigger budget and better writing. But having said that, the characters are so incredibly love-able I mean come on you cannot not love baby Yoda. Melts my heart every single time. I rate it 8/10 for season 1 but I do hope they gonna spend some dough on CGI and a more interesting story line. But this for now is a big + for Disney LOL.

saturnnia29 December 2019
I could write long and hard about everything (I loved) in this show, but it is mostly in the other reviews, what I will tell you is that it gives you that feeling you got watching the first movies that made us love Star Wars so much. For this I am completly subjective and biased and cannot see any flaws, this show literally saved Star Wars for me.

Finally, a Star Wars production Worth the name!
apgiannakopoulos29 December 2019
It is amazing how different things are when the writer of a movie or show is actually competent. Jon Favreu, what can I say I bow to the man, he took a franchise saturated with incompetent writers and producers and with 1/100 the budget he created something not just watchable but actually VERY GOOD.

Of course, some may say that with all the junk we've been fed by Rian Johnson and Abrams it is easy to put this on a pedestal....and they are right! Having said that this is a VERY good show in its own right not just because the movies are crap.

Highly recommended for any Star Wars fan out there its the best and only Star Wars content out there worth the name!

A must watch - period
mcampuzano8829 December 2019
Even though the last three movies have been so-so to put it mildly - Jon Favreau skillfully sets it's series on a league of its own. Disney and LucasFilms have been hiring fanboys as movie directors but Jon is a storyteller, someone who took his time caring for a franchise that the last movie directors didn't do.

He masterfully guides us through a post empire era, with great scale and finally some of the best character development in the Star Wars saga.

If this is the way (ha) Disney and LucasFilms will go forward with Star Wars I'm a hundred percent on board! Kudos to all of the directors, the actors and crew involved in this series, you achieved perfection and specially to Jon Favreau for crafting such a compelling story.

Season 1 - Rating: A
msbreviews29 December 2019
If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Star Wars is a very special franchise to millions of people around the world, myself included. I remember when The Force Awakens was announced, and everyone got excited and pumped to experience this beautiful universe once again. However, with social media having a massive impact, the huge fanbase transformed into something so disrespectful and hateful that I find no longer fun discussing the saga with other aficionados... except for The Mandalorian.

If I had to bet that Jon Favreau was going to create such an astonishing Star Wars series that the whole fanbase would unanimously love, I would have lost so much money because I would have bet against this. There's no denying that the newest cinematic trilogy is one of the most divisive in the history of cinema. But there's also no denying that The Mandalorian belongs to the saga's universally beloved pieces of cinema/television.

This show is a near-perfect depiction of what the universe looks like post-Empire. Some are looking for scraps of the war to make themselves some money, others are trying to hunt criminals to collect bounties, like The Mandalorian or Mando for short (I will use the latter to refer to the character). Following Pedro Pascal's lead character, one that has no name or face throughout the season can be a challenging task in the sense that it's hard to emotionally connect with someone who we wouldn't recognize in the streets. Except we do.

Pascal's facial performance might be impossible to evaluate, but his body movements and attitude are so unique that Mando can be easily distinguished from the remaining members of his Guild. Obviously, his costume also helps to tell him apart from other Mandalorians. However, it's the rich, intelligent writing that surprises me. After a few episodes, I feel like I know Mando, even if he doesn't say much. I understand his life principles, who he trusts, who he doesn't... Yes, there are a bunch of secret past adventures that molded him into being what he is (I'll get there). Still, a simple action like not selling something, not killing someone, or simply a helmet turn a bit faster/slower goes a long way to show the audience who's the character we are supposed to support.

Every single episode is packed with entertainment. There's always some action, and it always brings something new. It can be an innovative trick, a different location, or new characters like Baby Yoda, who undoubtedly becomes the star of the show, and I'll leave it at that. I won't develop or spoil what everyone is or does, but I do have to mention Gina Carano (Cara) and Carl Weathers (Greef Karga). Both are important to the storyline, and both actors deliver great performances. If Gina gives her all during the action sequences, Carl uses his eloquent speech to provide the necessary exposition.

If there was a slight doubt regarding Disney's commitment to this show, the mind-blowing production level shuts down any question about that subject. This series doesn't merely resemble Star Wars, it *feels* like Star Wars. The whole season looks absolutely stunning! Gorgeous cinematography, fantastic set designs, and even the costumes of each species look amazing. Technically, it's one of the best TV shows of the decade, and every director does a tremendous job.

One other aspect I love is how each episode feels different. Each director brings his/her personal filmmaking flair, making every chapter feel new every time. Dave Filoni, who fans will know from the animated Star Wars series, does a good job with the pilot. Deborah Chow, who's the sole director of the Obi-Wan series, delivers brilliant action and a fast pace. Rick Famuyiwa puts a horror vibe into his sequences. And Taika Waititi (who also performs the voice of a droid named IG-11) ends the season with a thunderous finale. However, it's due to Jon Favreau's screenplay that everything works together so seamlessly. Impeccable writing, especially concerning the protagonist.

I have just one issue with the debut season, which is the overall plot. For a long time, it doesn't feel like it has one. It feels like entertainment for the sake of entertainment, just with compelling characters. Following Mando from planet to planet, from mission to mission, can be tons of fun, but if that's all the season has to give, then that fun can quickly turn into monotony (chapter five is definitely the favorite for the worst episode of the season). A lot of questions concerning Mando's past keep coming up, and while I understand that the series needs to have something for a second season, I also feel that a few answers here and there could have helped the story.

If there's one thing that The Mandalorian proves is that Disney has more than enough capabilities to produce a great Star Wars piece... as long as it has someone supervising it with a clear plan and structure, which didn't happen with the sequel trilogy. It isn't a coincidence that the two episodes with no involvement of Favreau on the writing are the season's worst. The apparent lack of a central plot can be damaging, but not enough to steal the "best Star Wars TV series" crown.

With an outstanding cast and talented directors, Jon Favreau offers the world the opportunity to live in the Star Wars universe, following Pedro Pascal's character in some of the most entertaining adventures the saga has ever witnessed. Technically superb, with stunning cinematography, excellent editing, an addictive score (it can feel weird in the beginning, but it grew on me), and amazing directing from everyone involved. Nevertheless, it's Favreau's writing and well-planned season's structure that make this debut a gigantic success. Undoubtedly, one of the best shows of the year.

Excellent gunslinger story set in the SW universe. Numerous references to the movies in a thoughtful way, not just for the sake of nostalgia. Pure scifi without the fantasy/mystical elements of Jedi or the force.

This is the way for Disney's redemption
fernandovar9729 December 2019
When the next Star Wars trilogy hits (which we all know eventually it will) Disney has the chance of crushing it's own records made with the MCU and keep the fan base of a lifetime satisfied at the same time if Jon Favreau leads Lucasfilm and it's allowed to have the creativity and baldness he had with The Mandalorian. Not only he clearly knows how to do storytelling, you can also tell how passionate of a fan he is, and how carefully he orchestrated every detail in this perfect Star Wars fanfare. There was no need to fill the screen with pointless characters with no development or unoriginal stories from other "creators" that screw the Star Wars we knew this few years. Rest assured. Jon Favreau build something original without hurting any of George Lucas's legacy and actually paying homage to so many elements of the original trilogy, the prequels and the clone wars in a way that unbelievably works. It shows us all what we expected and more of the Mandalorian culture, great directing, impressive casting (Pedro Pascal kills it), and a memorable score from who I would really trust as the successor of the masterful John Williams in the Star Wars universe, Ludwig Göransson. It's Star Wars at it's best.

What an incredible season! Proof that a simple story line backed by a originality & good taste with the right creative minds - can easily top even the most over the top Star Wars 7, 8, 9 trilogy. Truly, the highlight of the season finale is the badass DARK SABER! Can't wait for season 2!

It's fine
pjobi17 December 2019
This is literally just an okay show. Nothing more nothing less. It's a Star Wars A-Team. It's fine. It's not a top 250 show of all time. Its not a bottom 250 either. Special effects are not great. Acting is not great. Just like the A-Team but fun to kill time with. The one big thing it's got going for it is the universe it takes place in, so there's always potential for bigger better things. I hope season 2 gets a budget increase. I'm not impressed but I don't hate it either. I wanted more.

The Worst TV Storyline
tharushadilshara23 December 2019
I watched 7 episodes of this show. I'm really not satisfied. I think this is the The Worst TV show Storyline I ever seen..even they use puppets and masks instead of CGI. Production quality is very lowest standard.They didn't even managed runtime of this show. We didn't see character development.This is like a kids show. Even some kids shows are better than this one..bad writing.I really not satisfied.. I'm not recommend this sh** show.. don't waste your time

Warning: Spoilers
Let me get this straight. In Episode 1 the "hero" kills the robot that saved his life. In Episode 2 he tries to steal an egg from a mother Rhino (kind of) and when she tries to stop him, he kills her, steals the egg (maybe it's the last of it's species but he doesn't know or care), and then gives it to a bunch of Jawas to eat. That's the hero!

Premise: A boring Firefly... yay...
nathanielneubert19 December 2019
Imagine Firefly without a soul. Now you don't need to watch The Mandalorian. The length of the scripts is about the same as Green Eggs and Ham. Nothing is developing. The whole thing is drawn out and overhyped. If this wasn't "Star Wars" then everyone would say what this really is, boring. You could cut out whole episodes with no impact on the current character situation. If you want a story about people walking a lot then go read Wheel of Time, all the walking you could want but it actually has a plot and more deep concepts and developments. If you want an actual space epic, watch Firefly.

Dumbing down America - lust for voilence 4 times per half hour required
junk3276713 December 2019
The style currently in vogue is unfortunately a violent life and death struggle 4 times per half hour, in which the dumbed down viewers don't know(?) that their favorite hero never fails to win, about every 7 minutes on average. How sad, how sick a reflection it is on the state of "American Culture". Its almost as if the many were but carbon copies of "son of Sam".

Great Addition to the Star Wars family
chema-6503113 November 2019
I had high hopes for The Mandalorian and was not disappointed. Right from the beginning when Mandalorian enters a bar & takes in two goons, cutting one in half when closing the door, I knew that Mandalorian will be a character with attitude & significant personality. Pedro Pascal does a fantastic job of portraying him. His voice has an aura about it.

Looking forward to seeing how this character develops & the morality journey he will undoubtably experience.

Love the addition of Carl Weathers. So much potential for his character - Greef Carga.

As an old skool Star Wars fan I'm finding it has everything I'd want, not forgetting the legacy but also adding innovative characters, plots and stories.

I got especially excited early on when I saw the use of Carbonite freezing, flooding my memories of Han Solo in Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi.

The special effects are superb.

Cannot wait to see how The Mandalorian develops. It shows great potential.

Wow that was proper
jimmyllewellyn13 November 2019
Possibly the best opening episode to a tv series I've seen. The people making this have had a riot and, while they get a bit carried away at times, overall this is excellent. It's interesting that people are hailing the return of Star Wars. I agree the feel of this one is similar to a new hope; rusty robots, broken down speeders, dodgy folk in bars etc. That said the reason this feels so good is that it's very different to what we've seen recently. Different rather than better. As per other reviews I hope they limit the overly quirky elements like learning to ride the monster horse. While there is nothing original here and it's very derivative, that's fine with me, it's pure entertainment and intrigue. I can't wait for the rest of the series.

Beautifully produced crap fodder-Inept & Insipid
rossmcdee125 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This series looks great, is a machine/tec fetish dream & has a story written by, & for, people lost in fantasy - without a shred of 'internal logic' or realism.

The yoda species sprog looks great, a cross between an un-watered Gremlin & Kermit the frog, with the eyes of a 'grey' alien. The production values are those of a major film & it shows, but the writing is just coke-fueled diarrhea.

Some would excuse the moronic storytelling as being for children- yet within minutes we witness a character being cut in half by automated doors, others are completely vaporized by the Mandalorians 'magic' weapon... and no one seems to have any regard for 'life'- even the yoda-like-sprog merrily eats small reptilian creatures while they are still alive... 'we battled the evil Empire so that we have the right to kill & eat anything we like- all life is fodder'

Those who rate this glossy garbage 9/10 or 10/10 are deeply seduced & spellbound by nostalgia & posturing...the story is utter garbage & told in an infantile manner, yet must be aimed at teenagers with no critical faculties and easily seduced by movie gloss & CGI- which is mostly superb except for too many poorly lit scenes.

The Mandalorian is an IDIOT who wastes a lot of time walking about when he could be using a 'razor toothed jogging tadpole creature', floating land-speeder, or even a jet pack like the ones all the other bounty hunters posses! His cloak serves no purpose except as a 'posing' accessory. He has no real plans to achieve anything he's doing (notably when getting the 'EGG' or rescuing new-yoda sprog) & is indestructible due to 'magic' armor. Even while getting thrown 100ft into the air and getting rammed by a fury rhino at about 100 mph he shows as much damage as you'd get from having a big burp or trouser billowing fart. When the Rhino is levitated by yoda-sprog the Mandilorian SLOWLY turns and 'gives a look' instead of piling in a crippling the beast... moments later he stabs it with a 'magic' penknife that penetrates its thick hide about half a centimeter.

He's so addicted to posing that he walks down the middle of the street in broad daylight instead of using any stealth or cunning, the yoda sprog trailing behind him unprotected, while 90% of the towns bounty hunters were aware of yoda-sprogs bounty, they initially leave him alone because he looks so fekin' 'cool'? ...un-fekn-belivable.

He has yet to bother researching the yoda-sprogs' species ('I think its an infant' he mumbles) despite the fact that THE Yoda must surely be a historically heroic figure since the battle with the Empire- you'd think he knew that these furry eared frog beings had telepathic powers & can use a light saber as well as Darth Vader when they mature.

When the 'scavenger monk beings' eventually receive the sought after EGG they dribble it all over the place... you'd think resourceful beings such as these would be actually resourceful!

Every scene seems to be written to insult the viewers common sense. To excuse any realism due to its 'fantasy/sci-fi' nature is also an insult to good fantasy & sci-fi -that all contain a logic specific to the story.

So, while marginally enjoyable due to its great production values, the story is so inept & insipid that this show can only be recommended for people with nothing better to do/shallow existences & an utter lack of discretion.

Brainless script.
alex_antoniu17 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
It would have been good if an adult would have wrote the script. It is absolutely ridiculous... or how to build a space ship on a field with only a blowtorch in one day... if you stab a chicken with a knife it would struggle more...

No heart
stengustafsson30 December 2019
The Mandalorian is a total disappointment. I love Star Wars but this series has no heart. The actors are all on valium except for the wonderful Werner Herzog.

Unbelievable
ajviele28 December 2019
Its unfathomable that Disney has turned Star Wars into cheap low budget syfy. This series belongs on the old syfy Network. At moments the story is really great then moments later its terrible. Sometimes it looks fabulous then moments later it looks like special effects I do on my laptop. As usual it's a slap in the face to the original SW. The acting and action are awful. They have turned bounty hunters into all around good guys? Wtf is Disney on crack?

Missed opportunity
krkkoala18 December 2019
They could've made something really special here if the writing didn't feel so thin. Each episode is a filler episode made up of filler scenes. There isn't much left to chew on after you watch it except for some pretty cinematography and old fashioned Star Wars visual effects. I watched each episode hoping the next one would pick up the pace and the series would start rolling, but I'm halfway in and it feels like nothing happened. It's a a shame that no one will remember this show ten years after it comes out.

tonedoogan12 December 2019
So far I've only liked episode 3. I know that Star Wars is going to make another ridiculous bad-guy-turned-good with this. It's annoying.

Star Wars lost intrigue long ago, I'd say it's back now.
michaelwelch01613 November 2019
The Mandalorian "Chapter 1" at first stumbles with pacing but manages to pull of a strong closing sequence, and demonstrates the marvelous cinematography and effects we've come to expect from Star Wars. The episode begins perhaps slightly too low with minimal development...followed by a middle that is perhaps slightly too rushed with some sequences coming off sloppy...but then something happens and it finds proper footing. The episode was kept simple and to the point clocking in at 40 minutes... which is just about enough time to establish the universe and profession we follow our protagonist traversing, but perhaps not enough time to establish heart or investment. At first, admittedly, it doesn't seem like there's much under the mask for a titular character. However, by the time we reach the closing credits we realize there's definitely a person behind that cold gaze and dry dialogue, and that this series is clearly about exploring who that person is... as well as the implications his own developments may have on the universe around him.

As Star Wars' first leap into live-action series, so far so good-enough. A "western" set in the Star Wars universe sounds good on paper and I'm fairly optimistic that it'll look good on my screen too.

Great start!
gy-att12 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The exterior scenes were looking awesome! Interior scenes are kinda weird. They look cheap and not well made. You watch the bartander scene and the bar desk looks too clean too new. His ships interior looks too clean and not well painted either. Costumes look like some cosplayers made it it, but not the best ones. Most of the outfit looked to new the ones (including the mandalorian or the stormtroopers) are looking too fakely broken down. I can see the paintbrush method. Music is great the characters are great. I love how they used puppets as well.

Thankfully on 30 minute episodes
evan_quinn-753394 January 2020
I can't imagine how bored I would be if I had to sit through eight hour-long episodes of this. No story, characters are boring, nothing that made me want to see another season. The only reviews of this that count are those after all episodes had been released, not those after two episodes and being fooled into thinking "baby Yoda" was anything but Disney making money

Plot and writing sucks
leeherrington-1995224 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
They trade special effects and nostalgia for a lack of real character development and writing. The only extended plot in the series is Mando's care for baby Yoda.

I'm going to keep watching it for baby Yoda for now.

Better than the low bar set by it's recent predecessors
TanneMalm25 November 2019
I'm glad that the greater majority is enjoying this show, truly I am.

However, I can't for the life of me give this show (as of right now) anything higher than a 5. It is average at best, story wise that is. I get that they're trying to show rather than tell, but what has really happened so far? We're almost halfway through the first season and my questions are only increasing.

I expect that answers will be given but when? Think back to some of the all time greats of tv-series: Breaking bad, Game of thrones (despite what you'd think of the later seasons it started out GREAT), Sopranos etc. We realized the story, or the premise rather, in the first episode of those shows, and, to me, the Mandalorian struggles greatly in this department.

I'm not saying that it is a bad show, because it's impossible to say before the season is complete. But it's not worthy of getting 10/10s, 9/10s in its current state.

56 cases of lazy writing in the first 6 episodes.
softsofa19 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Lazy writing happens when a writer resorts to the absurd and irrational because that takes the least effort. This results in heroes escaping certain death not through their actions, but by incredible luck. Or characters acting out of character. Or winning not through cleverness but because the other side is stupid. That's because writing something clever is hard; stupid comes easy. There are many other types.

The lazy writing listed below actually occurs in this series. These are arranged in the order they appear. The number before the dash is the episode number.

1-1. Auto-closing doors in tavern entrances don't stop until they cut you in half.

1-2. Some space ports are built on ice-covered lakes that contain the lairs of gigantic monsters that burst through looking for things to swallow.

1-3. The Mandalorian allows prisoners to wander about his ship unescorted.

1-4. The Mandalorian tolerates being cheated out of half his reward.

1-5. The Mandalorian takes new jobs from someone who has cheated him on a previous job.

1-6. The Mandalorian doesn't draw his weapon when he opens a door with 4 stormtroopers holding weapons behind it. However, he does draw his weapon when an unarmed civilian steps through a side door.

1-7. When a bad guy offers The Mandalorian a bounty that he seems happy with, that same bad guy will suddenly offer him lots more for the same job.

1-8. The Mandalorian can see blurrgs a mile away but can neither see nor hear them when they're close enough to attack him.

1-9. Blurrgs that bite you in the wild won't bite you if you're standing with them in a corral. You can even pet them.

1-10. The Mandalorian like long hikes. When he lands in a vast wilderness, he doesn't bring any sort of transportation with him.

1-11. Someone that often guides bounty hunters to a criminal's hideout is never back-tracked and killed by the criminals.

1-12. It's easy to sneak up on criminal hideouts that are surrounded by hills because they place no lookouts on those hills.

1-13. Most henchmen like standing in the open when shooting at The Mandalorian. Shooting from cover is for wimps who want to live forever.

1-14. Based on their shooting accuracy, henchmen have never participated in target practice.

1-15. Energy cannons that slice through blast doors like butter can't destroy a stone pillar shielding The Mandalorian.

2-16. If you kill a bunch of Jawas, then fall unconscious in front of the survivors, they wander away leaving you unharmed.

2-17. After killing Jawas, the ones you've left alive will still trade with you.

2-18. Sticking a knife a few inches into the side of a gigantic Mudhorn immediately drops them.

3-19. The Mandalorian has never removed his helmet, eliminating the need for head washing, scratching that unwashed head, and hair cutting.

3-20 Before assaulting a building, The Mandalorian likes to pound on the front door, destroy its security bot, then run away. This puts the numerous guards inside at ease before his surprise attack moments later.

3-21. When The Mandalorian hides in a small room with a few boxes in it, stormtroopers will walk right by him without seeing him.

3-22. A noisy shoot-out down a short hallway will cause a stormtrooper to look for enemies in the opposite direction.

3-23. When The Mandalorian enters a hole in the back of a building, instead of leaving through that same hole, he fights his way through that entire building to leave by the front door.

3-24&25. Repeat #1-12 and #1-13, replacing "henchmen" with "bounty hunters".

3-26. A cargo skiff with short sides is the perfect fortification when travelling across a courtyard while being shot at by dozens of people.

3-27. The Mandalorian likes leaving the hatch into his ship wide open while he's away. Only a refreshing breeze would dare enter...

4-28. When raiders loot a village containing fish and valuable robots, they only take the fish.

4-29. A 6-inch tall kid can walk at the same speed as The Mandalorian.

4-30. When The Mandalorian is following footprints that suddenly end, he can't figure out what's going on before he's attacked by the footprint-maker hiding a few feet from the end of the footprints.

4-31. If a kid with soup starts watching The Mandalorian fighting, the fighters immediately stop and go to a tavern to have drinks and a chat.

4-32. In a village full of children, The Mandalorian becomes alarmed if a child appears in a doorway 10 feet behind him.

4-33. The Mandalorian forgets episode #3 where he states that he never takes off his helmet. Now he takes it off all the time as long as no one is there to see him.

4-34. The Mandalorian sits at an open window with his helmet off... since he only takes it off when he can't be seen, the 6 children playing directly in front of him must be blind.

4-35. When The Mandalorian wants to secretly blow up a hut with unsuspecting enemies just outside the door, he uses an explosive that beeps loudly as it slowly counts down.

4-36. A session of target practice makes untrained villagers better shots than the previously mentioned henchmen and bounty-hunters.

4-37. Based on their shooting accuracy, the crewmen of Imperial Walkers have never participated in target practice.

4-38. Frightened villagers that run from raiders will bravely charge them if you give them a trimmed branch and a lesson on how to attack with a branch.

4-39. If you dig a single pit within a large area, an Imperial Walker will head directly to that pit and fall into it.

4-40. The Mandalorian informs us that if he ever takes off his helmet, he can never put it on again. However, he is wearing his helmet even though we saw him take it off earlier in front of those children.

5-41. The Mandalorian's ship can take a dozen energy cannon hits from an enemy ship, but one shot from his ship totally destroys that enemy ship.

5-42. When using powered binoculars to look at something far away, it helps to walk 10 steps closer first.

5-43. You can see Tusken Raiders and their huge mounts from a mile away across a featureless landscape, but you can neither see nor hear them before they suddenly appear right beside you.

5-44. If an expert sniper wings a man and that man starts running away, the sniper has to fiddle with her scope before firing again.

5-45. If you know that a sniper is waiting to shoot you, it's a good idea to stick your head out of cover to make sure she doesn't sneak up on you.

5-46. The best way to defeat a sniper is rush straight at her across open ground. Sneaking around out of sight and attacking from behind is for wimps who want to live forever.

5-47. If someone kills a fugitive The Mandalorian has tied up, he heads back to town without the body. Who needs "proof" to claim a bounty?

5-48. After travelling on a speeder bike for hours, the return trip on a slow-walking Dewback gets you back to where you started before the sun even sets.

6-49. The Mandalorian hates droids so much that he wouldn't let them repair his ship in the last episode. In this one, he lets a droid pilot his ship.

6-50. Before making high-speed maneuvers, a droid pilot doesn't warn its passengers to strap in. Instead, it bounces them off walls like dice in a dice cup.

6-51. When attacked, a prison-ship guard that can summon help by pressing a button in his hand, doesn't press it. He only threatens to press it.

6-52. Cell doors on prison ships have unlocking mechanisms on both sides. What's the odds that a prisoner would use it to escape?

6-53. When help is due to arrive within minutes, criminals loose on a prison-ship would rather search for the Mandalorian before they escape.

6-54. Earlier, a gang of criminals saw the Mandalorian destroy droids that they were helpless against. They decide to split up so that they can fight him one-on-one.

6-55. An experienced killer thinks that throwing a bunch of knives at the fully armored Mandalorian is the only attack needed.

6-56. While waiting to make an emergency escape, a pilot leaves his post to hunt for a harmless kid to kill.

Prepare yourself for more sleepy writing in future episodes...

Youwillhateme14 December 2019
The writing and acting is beyond terrible... Such a shame to see the amazing set designs, props, wardrobes, SFX etc to be ruined by the out of place bad music, horrible characters and actors.

And the worst part is it gets worse every episode.. the latest episode was a joke. What is this even about? Just random little stories with no relations to each other?

I literally have to force myself to watch this, and it's painful.

simsalabeem12 November 2019
Good music, good scenography, good dialogues. Everything is just too good, I love it (never been a big star wars fan, I skipped the last 3 movies because they were so generic). Feels like this is made for maybe older audience, rather than for kids like the latest star wars movies has been.

Vaguely Disappointing
homdeb105831 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
First off, I tend to disregard ratings of 10 of 10 (or 1/1) for any show and there are way too many 10/10's for this show for my taste. Like a car salesman trying to convince me a car is a good buy, when it's not. This is a good looking show but seems to have very little substance. Baby Yoda is the most exciting part of the show after 8 eps and my primary feeling is meh. Characters that added a little flavor like Cara Dune or IG-11 are here for a show or 2 and then gone. There's none of the "can't wait to see the next episode" like I got from The Expanse or Firefly or even Humans. If I could only watch either Mandalorian or NBC's Manifest, I would currently have to pick Manifest. The Mandalorian reminds me of that old Woody Allen joke: "This restaurant has terrible food. And in such small portions!" They can barely come up with enough iinteresting ideas for a 30 minute show, plus after 8 episodes one has to wait 10 months for the next season. I suspect that after I've rewatched all my favorite childhood Disney movies and the Marvel movies and a few movies I missed, I'll probably cancel my Disney Plus subscription and sign up for Prime so I can continue The Expanse. The Mandalorian has failed to generate enough interest to make me hang around for what comes next. 6 of 10 for me.

Lost_in_the_dark25 November 2019
When will everyone learn this is just rip off John wick action with video game plot and cut scenes between it all. Literally nothing happens but side quests and he keeps ending up where he started. So many useless scenes, lack lustre action and still no plot, stakes or character

It's playing it so safe with fanboys by looking good, playing with puppets and taking zero risks

I subscribed to Disney+ for this show. Frankly I love Jon Fav he is awesome but this show sucks. I absolutely do not care about anything that happens in this show. I'm not sure if it's the time at roughly 30 min per episode doesn't give me enough time to get invested or if really nothing of consequence is happening. I'll keep at it in hopes that it gets better but boy, I don't know

You know it's good when 38 min passed like 10
Turanic12 November 2019
The problem with most modern Star War films is that the trailers pretty much spoil the whole film. With "Mandalorian" as a TV show you have this gigantic "Star Wars" universe with a ton of opportunities and bags of Lore behind it... Remember the realistic style of Rogue One? This is it! So essentially we have a Star Wars Universe which looks completely authentic but has a slightly more realistic Rogue One tone, where anything can happen... I bet we will be on our toes when our faceless hero meets his first lightsaber wielding foe ... Due to the fact that anything can happen in this Star Wars universe, I am totally loving this show and that's the impression of the first episode . You don't know what awaits "Mandalorian" behind the next corner and that's the brilliance of this show, something that Star Wars films lost due to extensive Marketing campaigns...

watch the whole season before rating
robbag935 January 2020
It started out as a 9/10, in the middle it went down 3-4/10 and it ended with a 7/10 was really excited to start with and then around episode 5 it went downhill. episode 6 was a tutorial on bad acting and horrible characters. last episode saved it a little, but over all, a series shouldnt be rated 10/10 just because the first 4 episode were great , when the rest was crap

crtant318 December 2019
I was mildly intrigued the first three episodes and then the series fell flat. Around episode 4 I started feeling like I was watching a space version of the old TV series Kung Fu or the first BSG series in the 80's. Yawn.

Where's the story ?
hardseasailor26 November 2019
It's just some guy we never heard of before walking then fighting and more walking followed by more fighting with baby Yoda floating in a basket behind him there is no story,after three eps there should be some hint as to where this is taking us but no its just gives us nothing so unlike the fanboys and company shills rating this snooze fest 10 it's a four from me until there is an actual story to follow.

Great addition to the Star Wars universe
politicidal3 January 2020
Beautiful scenary, great action scenes, and a strong lead role make it a terrific space western show. The visual effects look terrific and the serial-like structure harkens back to the cliffhanger feel that Lucas gave the original films. The story and set-up is admittedly familiar. But Jon Favreau successfully recreates the vibe of the OT films. The tone is gritty w/o giving way to childish edgelord graphic violence.

This is the Star Wars we have been wanting for so long. Last two episodes felt to me like a separate movie. Series Mandalorian is filled with emotions, epic fight scenes, humour... Character buidling was also great. Loved it all the way. Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni thank you! I have spoken.

Better than the Movies
Weirdo-Magnet31 December 2019
I must say, i was getting pretty bored of the last few Star Wars movies. They weren't terrible but they weren't epic. This series has revamped the franchise and reignited my love for Star Wars. The feel of the original movies is so spot on. The cinematography is spot on. The action is amazing. The characters are brilliant. The CGI is awesome! I really think this has amazing potential to become a long running, epic series. If the next series is as good as this one i will be so happy. oh and if you're not a Star Wars fan just watch it for these 2 words: Baby.... Yoda.

Distracting low brow entertainment
meinnorthatl30 December 2019
Unbelievable that Star Wars fans will watch anything in the genre, no matter how simple and brain numbing it can be.

I am watching a couple of episodes and it just cemented for me that Star Wars itself is not for true science fiction fans. It is low brow fanboy fodder only.

The Mandalorian reminds me of the 90's Hercules and Zena series. Childishly simple plots, silly monsters, unbelievable escapes, and simplistic shoot and kill everyone scenes.

Ok, if you like good vs bad, no thinking action, with a little atmosphere but not much, and don't want to ever leave your Mom's basement, this is the perfect cinema for you and your hot pockets. Enjoy, even as a break from your video games.

Space western meets space John Wick. They should commission John Favreau to reboot episodes 1-3.

The Mandalorian gave me an excitement I haven't felt since when I was young watching sci-fi.
Dragonsouls28 December 2019
The Mandalorian is perfect storytelling and Star Wars at its finest since the original trilogy by George Lucas. It consists of a dramatic, yet simple plot, rich characterizations, beautiful cinematography, wonderful art direction, good comedy, excellent acting, and a perfect execution of the three-act formula.

The Mandalorian is created by the genius John Favreau, a man who produces quality of quantity and creates stories from his single, brilliant vision. He not only created a great Star Wars tale, for fans, but a great story that anyone can enjoy. Even my 67 year old mom loved this series, and she never watched anything Star Wars in her entire life. Kudos for Favreau for keeping Star Wars alive in epic fashion.

Disney this is the way
andrebonavita28 December 2019
I'm thinking, if Disney have Force to made this fabtastic series why made this awfull movie trilogy. Jon Favreau made a great screenplay for this Disney+ series. It have a good timing, good actors and great direction. If less budget Disney made more for the Star Wars fans than JJ and Rian Johnson. The main theme music is great too. Well done!

Pure Star Wars heaven.
JonathanSwain27 December 2019
The Mandalorian is truly amazing. I have really enjoyed each episode! Some are worth a 9 and others are an 8. The overall quality of the show is a solid 9/10 for me. Pure magic and an excellent ending.

Star Wars needed this
adamsr-1377327 December 2019
I'm not a hater of the Sequels, but this first season was certainly better than the Sequel arc. Star Wars needed this after how divided the fan base became after TROS. I've seen very little hate for anything Mando. I have spoken.

Perfect Star Wars
kristina-d-8090425 December 2019
Finally, after a very long time, we get proper Star Wars vibe! All characters are likable! The show takes itself seriously which makes it immersive and beautiful! ...and most importantly there's no annoying characters nor annoying humor which I just couldn't bear in the new Star Wars films.

This is just amazing, I'm enjoying this ride so much and I look forward to more!

Keep up the amazing work and thank you so much for making this!

So far..
xpunisherx22 December 2019
I'm only one episode in and I've never been a big Star Wars fan. However, bounty hunters and boba fett have always been my favorite of the universe. I jokingly thought about how it's PG since it's disney and it actually is... pretty basic storyline and dialogue, main character isn't that cool at all and I honestly hate the voice, especially through the helmet. I really hope it gets better, but I could've written this story so far.

Impressive visuals and music! If only it had the storytelling to match!
cocobinay20 December 2019
I suspect the glowing reviews are either from fans starved for any Star Wars content or those who are in this for the Easter eggs and callbacks. If you are watching for a coherent and halfway gripping story, bring something soft to bang your head on because you will need it!

THE GOOD: The visuals, the world-building, the music, oh, yes, the music. It's Star Wars as dreamed by any nerds worth their medals; STELLAR, no question! Also, BABY YODA!

Where it all falls apart, is in the story. Baby Yoda's impressive powers are introduced, but then you spend episode after episode wondering if they will have her/him do anything besides cooing and looking cute!

With Jon Favreau at the helm, plus Star Wars legends like Dave Filoni and Deborah Chow directing, you would expect a story with some continuity and decent pacing. Most episodes are just clunky expositions of Mando's backstory (Episode 6), or have plot twists you can see 200 miles away (Episode 5), or have cliffhangers with no payoff in subsequent episodes (Episode 5 again) or just kill off charaters they spent episodes building up (Episode 7)!

Half way in the series, you start to get the feeling that the show is taking forever to get to the point or maybe does not know how to get there! And with one episode left for this season, I'm looking forward to it not out of excitement, because I lost that by Episode 5, but out of curiosity about how or if the show will pull all these hanging threads together!

like a breath of fresh air
hannabrady20 December 2019
Personally, I think this is the first Star Wars spin-off that actually seems to live up to the franchise's name.

The Mandalorian himself subverted my expectations. I went into this show expecting an assholish, smug main hero with zero emotional tenderness, and what I got was quite the opposite. Mando is the strong, silent type, but he genuinely cares for other people and chooses to help people even when he expects to be betrayed.

Things I LOVE about the series:

1. The overarching father/child dynamic. Though he might not have verbally admitted it yet, Mando is baby yoda's Papa. It's so rare to find media that positively focuses on an adoptive parent/child relationship, and this show is doing it beautifully.

2. There's 0 forced romance. I'm so tired of watching series where the main character always ends up with his female friend. The Mandalorian throws this trope down the drain! He and Cara are bros

3. The return of puppetry! It really makes you feel like this is something out of the original trilogy when you see baby yoda and Kuiil's prosthetics. Everything blends together perfectly, much better than gummy-looking CGI.

My complaints:

1. There's a LOT of filler episodes. Episodes 1-3 had perfect pacing (and it picks up again in ep 7) but episodes 4-6 were just kinda. . .there. They were all short, action packed episodes where things got resolved quickly but didn't feel like they were earned. I understand they had to write in some episodes to make some time pass for Mando and the baby, but it could've been a bit more well done.

A true Star Wars series.
alexandros-niklan19 December 2019
This pays real tribute to the saga which recently has not been the same. CGI is not all over the place, and this little Yoda looks like a character that may promises a new saga under a new tittle maybe and a different story, but equally fascinating.

DISNEY, please, read this!
Sunnylight0171 December 2019
Let's be honest. STAR WARS movies were all about Luke and later Anakin Skywalker. The Original trilogy was great, and the Prequel trilogy completed the story. Perfect. The Sequel trilogy is not original nor interesting as the old Star Wars movies, we all can see it. It's stupid. Solo was also dull, and Rogue One I think was made ok by mistake or luck, whatever.

Now we have this TV show which is really perfect, and I honestly cannot believe it. I thought that the pilot will be great, and after that will fail like TFA failed after the 30th minute, but no. 4 episodes until now - great story, adventures, characters, music, and the atmosphere is amazing. Thank you! You made a piece of art. Please, try not to ruin it, and do not connect it with the new movies. Let's see more interesting planets and characters. And the "7 Samurai" episode is my favorite until now :)) Beautiful.

Incredible visuals, cinematography, dialogue and action
ed-yu-8330 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This show is brilliant as a standalone star wars show. Having very minor involvement of the bigger star wars story lore i feel as if this was anything else it would still be incredible. The action sequences are nothing like anything that has been on TV. The story line is great and the choice to go with the spaghetti western theme was good on Favreau. This is the greatest show on TV right now and who really doubted the house of mouse? Loving the cowboy drawing of his pistol in the first episode. Watched that scene over and over again, just like Blondie did.

mlcan18230 November 2019
I Loved the first 3 episodes. Watched them all at least 5 times a piece. After watching episode 4 I am really disappointed. Get rid of this female sidekick please. It's not believable for one second. Not to mention the shrimp farmers supposedly go back multiple generations yet they all look like completely different races and all with terrible acting. Let's be inclusive when it makes sense! I don't buy it.

Bloated and lacking anything to care about
crossmanbenjamin16 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The script is poor, what script there is. Some lines, and their delivery, are downright laughable. It is hard to care about the main character when he barely speaks, and all we get is tidbits about the history and beliefs of his culture and the anticlimactic ending to episode one to drive the plot forward.

The plot seems like it is straight out of a computer game. He is simply given quests, and then side quests, and baddies come from below, above, in front or behind to be dispatched. We even get boss levels and a big gun to fire. Why? We know he won't die.

The music is awful, and I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief whenever it really kicked in. It could not add excitement or tension to any of the fight scenes, and completely lacked the gravitas and sense of the sublime awe that John Williams original score provides the films.

The biggest problem is even in episode one, it feels bloated by scenes that are disconnected and redundant, and that often don't make any sense. Why on earth we need to see a monster grab hold of his ship for a minute is beyond me. Episode two is worse. Why the hell does he need to learn to ride a horse thing? Where the hell did the horse thing go when he was capturing the bounty? If he needed it to get there, as we are told in the dialogue, doesn't he need it to get back? Why the hell do we need half an episode of him recovering the parts to his ship?

The direction of these scenes doesn't help. As others have remarked, it is like they are copy-pasted from better movies.

Surely the beauty of sci-fi is that it can surprise us by asking 'what if?' but this series so far has been bogged down in recycling stuff from the original films, and a bunch of cowboy tropes, in a very unsatisfying way.

I will stick around just to see what exactly what they series' subtext is. There is just enough meaning in the allusions to cowboy culture, American Indian beliefs, and lines like 'I'm a Mandalorian, weapons are part of my religion' to suggest that the show might have something topical to say.

But if an antagonist and some good dialogue don't turn up soon I am out. I can't watch a man in a helmet walk woodenly around for long.

laurentdelvigne-8650813 November 2019
Thanks you Disney to allow a creative and experienced team that really loves the franchise from the animated series Clones and Rebels (not like the current trilogy). This is a good start !

We are immersed in the universe back in the 70's and 80's. With modern VFX, good storytelling, great production designs,....

Can't wait for the next episode.

Started off great!!!
Marynewcomb201314 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
6 episodes in and it's just not what it started out to be!! First three episodes were fantastic!! They had the Star Wars feel & made you think it was going to carry on the real tradition of Star Wars & then it's taken a nosedive!! It's seems to be going into a more survival of the fittest type show than What you would find in Real Star Wars Canon!!! The sixth episode was so predictable that it was funny!!! You knew right off after he was introduced to the "team" they were going to turn on him & you knew he would take the payout!! You also knew he would set up his old "partner" to get taken out!!! Jon & crew must revert back to what they were doing as producers in the first three episodes & learn!!!

Three episodes in and it is...alright. **UPDATED**
hammy-3835925 November 2019
I have to agree with other reviewers that people giving this show 10/10 are just getting carried away...or they are children. I see it as being rather thin and lacking in any depth or story so far. That would appeal to young people who are just excited to be watching Star Wars. I am not saying it is rubbish (garbage). It is very well made it is just lacking substance. It actually feels to me to be in a similar vein to Flash Gordon. So short and episodic that nothing develops.

Early days yet. Hope it improves as there are a number a very talented people in the mix.

**UPDATE**

Watched the rest of the season over Christmas. Started to really enjoy it about episode four. The one where he goes into hiding and does a smaller version of the Magnificent Seven. I was pretty much hooked from then on.

Need to give myself a bit of a pat on the back because I have just noticed that four of the last five episodes ran over 40 mins. For me it appears to make it easier and more engaging for a science fiction story if it runs at round 40 - 50 minutes or so.

Anyway, looking to the next series.

So far so boring
athirn17 November 2019
No Star Wars vibe at all. The Mangalorian is so boring, that even R2D2 is much more expressive than this walking manikin. I really don't understand all the 10-star reviews. Is the audience really so unpretentious these days? It's so soapish, what's to like so much? It's not a disaster, but 10 stars are much more than it deserves. :-(

Snore Wars VI: The Revenge of Bob Iger
jon123nyc22 November 2019
Granted, it's early yet, but I'm suffering from the mundane, plodding course of the storyline's arc (both storyline and arc are rhetorical, because they don't exist)! If some dolt decided to re-do The Star Wars X-Mas special, while leaving the script 'as-is', it would most likely be a slickly produced steaming pile of Bantha poodoo.

Some will resort to a standard Lucas' cop-out, when defending his latest 'Jar Jar moment', saying, "well of course you don't like it. You're not the audience; this is for kids!".

One particularly ridiculous example of what I mean, occurs when an alien's body is sliced in half, by an automatic door closing. My 9 year old asked me why future doors don't come with safety features.....that if they have Technologies to travel faster than the speed of light, shouldn't they be able to manufacture a non-lethal aitomatic closing mechanism? (My little weirdo likes to run in and out of them when I take him shopping, so he'd know. Since he's not missing a hand).

The real shame is that it COULD have been really GREAT. It's been years, so I don't remember the plot, but the SW Universe books focusing entirely on a Mandalorian (again, forget who, exactly), were among my favorites. Considering there are probably over 100 books; that's saying something. Mandalorians are badass!

Sadly, The Mandalorian, on Disney +, is not. A victim of sloppy writing, directing, and production. But mostly the writing.

Disappointing show
jkdgymodense16 November 2019
The first episode startet of fine but was somehow underwhelming with a very short running time of only 38 min. Episode 2 had a running time of only 30 min.!!! And the episode was very weak. So disappointing. Was expecting a show with the same high quality as the best out there (Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones etc.) but this is not the case. This is a star Wars sitcom :( Also, the music does not feel very "star Wars". Hopefully the Kenobi show will be better.

What a waste of time !
grancruz13 November 2019
Let start out with the cgi looks terrible ! That blue guy never stops talking ! Bobba fett has always been one of the most boring characters in Star Wars to me ! (Give me knights of the old republic ...tell me more lore of Star Wars the Jedi ..the sith ...) this show for the most just misses the mark for me ! It's boring and short a 39 min episode and your staggering them out week by week Disney what are you doing ? People aren't gonna stay because your putting episodes out week to week ! You would think they would have put all the episodes up to binge ! Netflix continue doing what you do best and don't follow after Disney ! The quality of this show is nothing like game of thrones or Netflix originals ....Disney plus is a joke ...all these movies I seen before ! You release like 6 new shows and expect to get people to watch ....most people already own all these movies stop wasting our time !

not entertaining
kbx122 November 2019
I feels like a very cheap version of SW universe. Like they have salvaged some props from original saga and decided to make a show with it. It lacks star wars charm and atmosphere. The world feels shallow and empty, with few star wars props put here and there to convince us its SW universe alright. After two episode I have lost interest. It is just not... entertaining.

Very Disappointing Thus Far
redhotfuzz26 November 2019
I'm one of the old-timers who waited in long lines as a kid to see the original Star Wars films at the local double-dome (two screens) theater. I count myself among the original Star Wars fans. I was extremely excited for The Mandalorian. My expectations thus far remain unfulfilled. This show through episode 3 plays like the storyline to a mediocre AAA video game: middling action scenes interspersed with robotic cut scenes featuring corny dialog and characters you just don't care about. (And Carl Weathers has forgotten the few acting skills he used to have.) The formula here looks painfully simple: Star Wars nostalgia + Iron Man + John Wick - the excitement of any of those franchises = The Mandalorian. My question when I saw the previews was "Can we really care about a character who never shows his face?" And the answer thus far is no. It's difficult to invest in a human character that moves and talks like a robot.

I don't know where all the 9+ reviews are coming from, but this series so far is not worthy of the hype. I'll keep watching with the hope it improves.

the Mandalorian is basically boba fett series
aristhocratic13 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
With less than an hour, even with minimal main character dialogues, this first episode of Mandalorian seems to have a better direction than the sequel trilogy on the big screen, or the worst prequel spin-off "SOLO". Mandalorian is basically a spin-off version of the star wars in the Boba Fett series but with a less cash to George Lucas🤣. With an action style of "Western" Flicks, the western world filled with cowboys and "bounty hunters", gritty, realistic Star Wars world with a scuffed armor of the main character, white storm troopers armor that looks dirty, I could feel more sense of homage to the original star wars. And it turns out that the cool droid bounty here is the IG-11 series, IG-88's close relative, the tinman droid from the original trilogy. The use of the "huttese" dialect and a brief appearance of a Kowakian monkey-lizard, similar to Salacious B. Crumb spit-roasted and watched by another in the cage makes me laugh. There's even a homage to baby Delta "Camtono", which I think is an ice cream container filled with beskar, a mandalorian credit metal for armor upgrade😁. With the surprising appearance of baby wise alien species at the end of the episode, the series is quite entertaining in such segments, plus the visuals of some of the creatures are also fun to watch . Without enough main character dialogues, and a bit lacking in scripts and background music, for me it's not a problem anyway. With the star wars franchise that have fallen apart, at least John Favreu and his friends including Dave Filoni, Bryce Dallas Howard, yes, Bryce from Jurassic World, even Taika Waititi, seemed want to save a few of good star wars elements in the hands of Disney. Hopefully, if this will work until the final episode, Disney has learned to take steps from here for their next cow-cash projects. HE'S NO GOOD TO ME DEAD, WE MANDALORIANS DON'T MAKE THREATS, WE MAKE PROMISES, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!

Doe not worth the time wasted to watch it
DariusLaBareIII15 December 2019
Unfortunately for the great saga of Star Wars, The Mandalorian is one of the worst tv series I ever had the "pleasure" to watch. The words Naive, Artless, Superficial, Dumb are NOT enough to describe the poorness of the plot. Mando goes, Mado has trouble, Mand wins this is the plot, of every episode and to add more depth to the character"this is the way" and "none seen his face" are added to create an aura of complexity and introspection. Miky Mouse in confront is a machiavellian Character with a tortured soul. Unfortunately, there is no smallest value of 1/2 star

Ok, not great
gormmatt-9357822 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Production value is definitely there, as you would expect from a Star Wars tie-in, but the story is somewhat lacking. We're led on to believe that the Mandelorian is at the top of his game but frequently requires help to get out of even the simplest situations. Also, not to give anything away, but a huge plot point in this series has not been mentioned even in the slightest degree in the New Order Trilogy. I understand why they incorporated it in this series but something this big would have to have a link to the main movies as well. While my hopes are high for the story to shape up as time goes on, at this point I'm not impressed

With a solo episode, Star Wars Returns.
thesar-214 November 2019
The Mandalorian Questions: Why does an expert bounty hunter who lives in his helmet need a monocular? Wouldn't his helmet be able to Robocop Zoom Vision? Also, why do droids need currency? And finally, why couldn't they make Episode VIII and Solo this good? This was only 39 minutes and was 10x more enjoyable than the last two Star Wars movies combined.

Anyways, Episode I of THE MANDALORIAN (3½/5 Stars.) I have spoken.

I hate this show so much...
aydenjenkins28 December 2019
This show is an insult to Star Wars. Terrible writing and acting. There's absolutely no story. No character arcs. No major twists and turns. Nothing interesting. The character of the Mandalorian is so pathetic and uninteresting. The side characters are even worse. There's no major conflict. No central villain. I guess Giancarlo is the villain, but he doesn't show up to the end and his character sucks too (which is sad because he's a great actor). Almost every episode is bad. The only half decent episode is the 7th one, but that's it. Overall, a terrible addition to the Star Wars universe and is an insult to Star Wars as a whole. I can't imagine what season two is going to be like...

Unwatchable.
lemrs16 November 2019
I am not a star wars fan, much less the expert but nevertheless i just need to say this. This show sucks balls. Great production, great efx, solid characters but what the heck is this show about and when will it create a dialogue worth listening and stop throwing us from meaningless to even more meaningless and boring filler scenes.

Also massive error 404. Logic not found, peace.

I wonder were all the money went
rogerpostma17 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
It sure didn't go in the writing, acting, cgi. The bounty Hunter character is the softest one in the galaxy. The dialogues are predictable, boring uninteresting and give no character build what so ever. Yoda looks like a green gremlin. Would a cliffhanger perhaps be an idea at the end of ep 1? Or not showing the Mandalorian as a soft sucker, and only letting Yoda live for the reward? What kind of bounty Hunter is surprised by 200 kg animals charging him? The interaction with the droid during the fight was dreadful.

But what I really hate about Disney Plus. I'm streaming this from the Nvidia Shield and the sound is terrible. Same goes for every Star Wars movie. With a full Atmos setup, only streams I receive are dolby D+.

Dull
darius_sutherland15 November 2019
I found the first episode dull as dull can be. Special effects were ropey. Not even going to waste my time.

Not a huge fanboy but just want good tv / story and this wasn't it.

This is what STAR WARS should be in 2019
asanfira14 December 2019
Rating The Mandalorian with only 10 stars seems a bit unfair to be honest, but it will have to do. The show brings back the nostalgia and the polishness of the intial trilogy, a sensorial delight that the recent Star Wars movies never managed to grasp, and moves it forward by adding another layer on top, thus bringing the show to what you would expect out of 2019 technology. From oldschool cathode ray tube display and puppets to state of the art CGI, the show has it all. Action, mystery, a touch of comedy, you could literally not ask for more then another season asap. I really love the show and hope that future seasons will only be better, because this is what Star Wars should have been all along.

P.S. don't miss out on each episode's outro, you will have a treat :).

Bait and switch
chrisbalv30 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I believe IMDB is about finding those with similar tastes in film and TV , not attacking peoples opinions. Too each their own though.

Let me start by saying, Star Wars ended for me after the first trilogy. The prequels had a Star Wars feel but lacked the magic and just had to many cringy moments. The Disney Star Wars movies are unwatchable . All of them.

Now, the Mandalorian had a lot of hype behind it, so what the heck , lets take a look. I tried to watch it and turned it off. I waited a couple of weeks and decided ,lets try again. This isn't the first time this has happened. I guess sometimes you are just not receptive to a certain type of movie at a certain time.

I watched the first episode, and thought the acting and some of the dialogue is cheesy but the original Star Wars wasn't the pinnacle of dialogue either. Now, the main character doesn't say a lot which is fine by me. He is a bounty hunter not an auctioneer. The fighting is a little slow and weird but he is wearing armor , give it a pass. We move on to the 2nd episode and it is holding my interest and I know what to expect because of the 1st episode exposure. I wasn't impressed with the John Wick Bounty hunter droid though. Without that droid the series would be over because the Mandalorian would be no more. Seriously the droid killed at a ratio of 4 to 1 at least.

The 3rd episode is where I feel " a disturbance in the force" something is creeping in. Mando is speaking more and is losing that "badass" aura. Maybe the show is about making him more squishy and less rigid bounty hunter like. I think baby Yoda is an anchor for Star Wars and is trying to tie it to what is familiar.

The 4th episode is where it goes off the rails for me. It was like the little house on the prairie episode. Disney cannot resist injecting their pc culture into movies . This is definitely a bait and switch . I have to give it 2 stars because I made it to 4 episodes but I won't be watching anymore.

The Good, The Bad & The Nerf Herder.
aheartofdorkness13 November 2019
When Disney first announced that they were going to be making STAR WARS spin-offs, I thought that, instead of being prequels or stand alone movies based on preexisting characters, they should all be original stories in different genres? I wanted to see a heist movie, a horror film and even a slapstick comedy all within the STAR WARS Universe. Well, THE MANDALORIAN is if Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name character lived in a galaxy far, far away.

The first episode is a well crafted introduction with an interesting lead. The effects appear to be mostly practical with CG being used sparingly, which is welcome after the overuse in the prequel trilogy. The costumes and make-up are of cinematic quality and it is very obvious no expense was spared.

I will be tuning...err, I mean streaming the next episode when it becomes available next week as I feel this may be what all of us old school STAR WARS fans have been wanting to see.

Horrible!!
vmacchia14 December 2019
I have to agree with some of the other reviews, this is a children's TV show under age 12. The cinematography & CGI are pretty good but aside from that, it is very bland and boring.

Poor writing, acting & music score. It started off ok in the first 2 episodes and then went downhill real fast. This is nothing like 'Rogue One' or 'Solo'.

No offense to anyone who likes this. It's only my opinion and certainly not my cup of tea for what I think Stars Wars should be.

It starts hopeful, but there is no real story
tom-jansen-903-68866128 December 2019
The serie looks and feels like the original Star Wars movies. But the very weak storyline unfolds a serie without any real plot or underlinging story. After 5 episodes I stopped watching.

It's alright, I guess...
little-wing26 November 2019
Almost half of the first season in at the time of this review. And still I'm looking for something to care about.

The beginning was really sloppy, with terrible pacing and directing by Pablo Hidalgo. The second episode is kind of skippable, as nothing really important happens. And the third episode missed all opportunities to finally give our protagonist an interesting story.

One of the obvious problems is the helmet that our hero has to wear all the time. So his expressions are very limited. A good director would really play into that and let the pacing, blocking and interactions show us what's under the armor. Unfortunately, we are not given many moments for that. And that's why the makers of the show made the cheap decision to introduce a creature whose purpose is to be adorably cute. Of course, that is not a good replacement for good writing, arcs and storytelling. Because I wouldn't let the creature's cuteness distract me from everything else about the show (all the missed opportunities, the pacing, acting and writing issues), until now I don't know why I should care what happens to these characters. I hope all the success of this show won't tell Disney to spend money on a very cute creature, great props and sets, so we don't notice all the flaws. And I really hope the show can change my mind. Because the setting is exactly what I have been wanting for a long time...

Kind of bored now
andrew-hill51525 November 2019
Ok, it's 3 episodes in, and I'm officially already bored of this show. I made it about half way through the third episode and paused it to pee. I couldn't be bothered to continue the episode, which shows its entertainment value.

I wonder if anyone wanted this show. I mean, apart from calling himself the most feared bounty hunter in the... Galaxy? Universe? Parsec? Whatever, then failing miserably and dying immediately in a display of totally useless, why would a show about an identical guy being less useless be considered a worthwhile thing to make?

I guess they made all the Star Wars films since the original trilogy was considered good in the 70's and early 80's, which have all been terrible since those mediocre films were made, so I guess any old guff was probably considered worth making.

It's probably hedging bets, because everyone is anticipating the Rise of Skywalker being bad, because the last 2 films were poor and poorly received and not well liked, as well as Rogue Something and Solo and the prequels. All of which gave rise to the fact that I don't know a single person who thinks Star Wars hasn't sucked for at least 30 years. Maybe 40.

Actually, the first one in this new trilogy with Ray was kind of watchable, despite it being a pretty poor film, as long as you turn you brain off and just watch the visuals while trying to ignore the story, as just a bog-standard piece of fluff, because it is just a popcorn movie.

Good craftsmanship but quite boring
tomasj-haavik17 November 2019
Two episodes in and I can't yet see why I should bother to care about what will happen next. Nice CG and VFX and '77 vibes - but the helmet really makes it hard to root for the guy He kind of blends in with the droids and the extras wearing rubber masks. Giving him just a few lines in each chapter doesn't help. Tough task, Pedro! Will give the next chapter a chance as well but if things don't improve I'm outta here.

Captures that Stars Wars magic
amesmonde13 November 2019
A bounty hunter makes his way through the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic.

Directed by Dave Filoni The Mandalorian chapter one is excellent, it may not be a feature length film but this live action series is thankfully the next best thing. Created by Jon Favreau and with Disney and Lucas Film wallet he offers great production values, practical effects, hidden FX and a music score to match, it does not disappoint.

Actor Pedro Pascal expertly echoes Boba Fett injecting his own nuances and movements into this new lead character. The tone is perfect and feels like Star Wars should.

It is not just all new Uber characters and elements. It welcoming builds and expands George Lucas' established universe. For example recycling/reusing established species and droids (including the Ewok's Battle for Endor's Blurrgs) to name but a few. Filoni also offers an IG bounty droid mirroring the IG-88 ESB character. You get to see a bounty droid in action.

With a job from Carl Weathers' Greef Carga, Pascal's Mandalorian tracks a target for a well-paying client (Werner Herzog) he freezes and shoots his way through the episode with The Man with No Name prowess. With the help of an indigenous character Kuill (voiced by Nick Nolte) and the bounty droid IG-11 our hero proves his honour durning a surprise reveal of a familiar unknown Star Wars species at the closing of the first episode.

Overall, aside from a small handful of iffy CGI it's pretty much a TV Star Wars action adventure dream come true.

If it walks like SW, looks like SW, sounds like SW..
dpoland-7658912 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
...then it's Star Wars.

Update: seen second episode. What the hell is up with the short episodes? 30 min for the second one? While also being disappointed that the force snuck its way into this series and I'm getting a little worried about this being a show about a baby sitter in space rather than a bounty hunter I'm still glad for the show as below. Rating lowered from 9 to 8...

I enjoyed this first episode even with insanely high expectations. One major issue was that the episode was way too short.

It has the feel that I've longed for but with some new characters and plot. My favorite SW film since the original trilogy is Rogue One and this series seems to have the same "feeling".

The self destruct jokes were enough humor and while being a little fast pace, and had a minor ridiculous hiccup around the Blurgs (?), it was a really nice coming "coming home" moment. I'm hoping it'll keep on this track but I'll update my score if anything changes.

Watch it and just let yourself get lost in a galaxy far far away for a bit!

The ewoks strike back
Movie-Inspector15 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
To make it quick: if you think that the Ewoks of Return of the Jedi were or are still a bad and ridiculous idea you probably won't like The Mandalorian much. If you like(d) those teddy-bears and that humor stuff of the 2nd triology (those droids etc.) you may like it. All in all rather disappointing and the stories (2 eps) released are of the quality of all those animation series build on the Star Wars franchise. A mildly entertaining time killer but the little green thing just bored the hell out of me - not again a circle in a circle of a circle... Tell us something new - I hoped for a REAL headhunter, the story about a bad ass dude - but, well, it's Disney and now we get a Madalorian babysitter... Besides the original three movies only Rouge One got real quality, the rest is more or less well-produced garbage.

Totally disappointing. Lacked the vibrance of past shows/films
nilslewenhaupt14 November 2019
TLDR; I dont know what they spent the 100 million dollar budget on, but it certainly wasn't the first episode. I don't know where all the great reviews are coming from, the sparse amount of dialogue in the first episode was painfully clumsy, the set design was very poorly done, the soundtrack was entirely underwhelming, and the special effects were reminiscent of a cheaply made show from the SyFy channel. It lacks the life that filled every shot in the original sagas, where even in the desert planet tatooine there was bustling cantinas and roving bands of tusken raiders, and the almost total lack of music makes the show seem like it was made by some college students on a shoestring budget. Although they did do a great service to the lore behind mandalorian armor, it becomes totally undone by the abscence of the proud, calculated, and merciless ways of mandalorian warriors in the main character. It would of been fine if it tried to march to it's own beat, and distance the protagonist from the more reserved and unwavering image of mandalorian warriors we've seen in the past, but instead it tries (and fails terribly) to liken itself to its predecessors (clan vizla, jango fett). I'm in awe of the sheer number of rave reviews, it seems eerie! Did we watch the same episode? Lotta cool Easter eggs though. Hopefully the show will find its footing...

Boring. A video game with distracting side quests. Coming from a Star Wars fan
whikitywhack14 January 2020
The story line is slow going. I thought the first two episodes were okay, but they could have been condensed into one. Episodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 are nothing but boring side quests, and you can skip those episodes and still get the entire story, except the non-important backstory of the female. Episodes 7 and 8 were the only ones that were actually good. And this is all coming from a Star Wars fan who is always excited for more.

Predictable plot in an atmospheric SW decorations
odiumish10 January 2020
Really dont understand all of this hype about Mandalorian. Every second of every episode is so predictable that you have to turn off your brain to enjoy the show.

Disney did massive damage to SW universe with their trash trilogy, and this made SW fans desperate for some good content. But this desire to actually get a good on-screen SW action certainly doesnt have to dictate your opinions on watching this mediocre tropy series.

Great Season with a Bad Finale
prestage-0633228 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
First off, the season was great overall, and I cannot wait for season two. And while this finale had some great moments (Mandalorian Jet Pack Scene and the Dark Saber reveal), I found it to be the weakes episode overall by a significant margin.

The standoff in the beginning made no sense. If Moff Gideon didn't care that much about retrieving the child (Proved later in the episode) then he would have burned the place down right away. Not "waiting until nightfall" when you clearly have the upper hand. Also, anyone with half a brain would have realized the heroes wouldn't harm the child, so you could have just stormed the building. Moff obviously didn't care about his troops lives, so what's the harm.

The battle in the courtyard had terrible choreography, the good guys didn't even try to find cover, and the gun fight was ridiculous. Especially so considering the shows previous battles were great.

The acting and dialogue was also a bit cheesy, and for the first time it felt like they were reading lines rather than being in the moment. And IG 11 was supposed to protect the child, so he drives into 50 stormtroopers. Great job IG 11. There is more that bothered me but you get the point.

Again...great season. But the finale was not what it could've, and should've, been.

Really consistent/incredible season
jmerithew87-561-64975627 December 2019
This is the Star Wars show I've personally been waiting for. It respects the source material and has a lot of nods to it, while showing us things we haven't seen in live action Star Wars media before.

I wanted to hold off until I saw the full season before giving my thoughts, and I was not disappointed at all. The fifth episode was probably my least favorite, but it was still very good. This show really held its quality all the way through, and I absolutely cannot wait for season 2.

The best thing happened to Star Wars since Star Wars
eryui22 December 2019
Not the usual battles in space, not the usual lightsabers, not the usual princesses and confusing plots. The setting is that, but that's it. This series takes what's good in Star Wars and makes it more easy and fun to follow. The Disney touch makes it a little sweeter. The soundtrack is a masterpiece and finally different from the classic. Nice episodes, from the start to the beautifully painted end credits different in each chapter. They tell the stories of a cryptic bounty hunter (you almost never see his face) with a thread that connects them: the baby Yoda (a very funny and sweet character). I never liked that much Star Wars, but I fell in love for this one.

10/10 A classic in the making. For all the ages. I have spoken.

This feels like real Star Wars
john-gilmore198217 December 2019
Star wars should be about the people and things in the galaxys the different races and how it all fits together or doesn't. This is what the Mandalorian feels like. The Jedi and the Force should be mystical and unseen to the point that if you do see a Jedi it's a magical experience. Please please keep moving in the direction you going.

The only thing NOT COOL about this is it's US only.

The best thing from Star Wars
mario_parish14 December 2019
This show is not just a piece from the Star Wars universe, but a Masterpiece. I like that the show continues to be a bit edgy with adventure as not all adventures should be a cushioned worry free ride. John has captured the excitement and adventure that Star Wars has offered in the past. Oh and the child in the show doesnt hurt either.

What's with the hype?
ryancdog7 December 2019
I was extremely excited for "The Mandalorian" and it is the reason I subscribe to Disney+ but after watching 5 episodes I'm not that impressed or happy with it. First off I'm disappointed it's only a half hour long instead of being an hour long which it should be, I dont understand why the went with half hour episodes. It just makes it drag on and hard to watch.

Each episode is kinda boring and not much really happens, I mean after 5 episodes not a whole lot had really happened that couldn't of been made into a single 1 hour episode. What's the point so far for this series to exist? It's not going to be able to keep viewers happy for long at this pace. The only reason for all the 10 star reviews (which it does not deserve) is because it's different from the horrible movies Disney has cranked out since acquiring Star Wars.

Baby Yoda is the only real reason I'm still interested and watching. It is exciting for me to see where they take this character to. I'm hoping he/she (whatever the baby happens to be) becomes something like what Yoda was as a Master Jedi. It'll be interesting to see what happens to it. I just hope this series gets more exciting and hopefully next season they will go to an hour long episode instead of this half hour, it's just not long enough for this show. I'm hopeful "The Mandalorian" will be around for a few seasons at least and maybe even a movie about it later.

Great up until Ep 4. Hope it's just a misstep and not a sign of things to come.
thatsgottahurt-13 December 2019
I have really enjoyed the Mandalorian. It's been fun and enjoyable. The plot has been compelling , and the cast more than competent. That is, until episode 4. Ep 4 is by far the weakest instalment of the series. A (very) derivative and well worn plot is a real let down. It adds nothing to the overall narrative and doesn't move the story forward virtually at all with the exception of adding a couple of new, and probably recurring, cast members. You've seen it all before, many times, and it disappoints greatly.

Jon Favreau perfects the art of Star Wars story-telling Post-Lucas
MinistryofDoom2 December 2019
Jon Favreau has done it again! He is the best thing to happen to the Disney brand since Walt himself. Everything he touches is gold whether it's live action adaptations of classic Disney Animated films (Jungle Book, Lion King), Directing/Producing MCU films (Iron Man 2), and now...writing, directing, and producing the Disney+ Star Wars series, The Mandalorian.

This series is so well written, so well produced that it could easily fit within the mainstream Star Wars franchise as yet another big budget blockbuster film. I cannot express to you how well written is this series. It is obvious that Favreau is a die-hard Star Wars fan and meticulously knows the lore and legends of the Star Wars Universe. Everything from the framing of shots, to the transitions between scenes, to the sound effects, and cinematography, landscape, costumes, etc...All exude love and dedication to the Star Wars brand. It is full of fan service that will make people immediately geek out, but it also tells an original and compelling story, a space western, set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, which would immensely appeal to both veteran fans and unseasoned newbies.

In terms of the timeline, it takes place after Return of the Jedi and before Episode VII: The Force Awakens. Pedro Pascal takes on the title role of The Mandalorian, a mysterious bounty hunter in a long line of bounty hunters has previously included the late Jango Fett and his clone, Boba Fett, both of whom played very important roles in prior Star Wars film trilogies. The Series follows The Mandalorian as he works for various clients, including the last few remaining members of the old Galactic Empire and that is all that I will say. You will need to experience this series for yourself but whether you have seen all the Star Wars films before, or you know nothing at all about Star Wars (Where have you been?), I assure you that you will greatly enjoy watching The Mandalorian. If this is the direction of Disney+, I am all on board. A+ all the way.

Good, but not as good as the fanboys are making it to be.
Deniz19991 December 2019
I like Star Wars, have seen them all multiple times, but I am not a fanboy or biased like a lot of people are reviewing this series.

It's not bad by any means, I enjoy it, but the few episodes that have come out now have been very predictable and nothing mind blowing. The fanboys are just really overhyping the show, which may lead to high expectations, which I had and then left a bit disappointed.

Extremely impressed so far
doooofy1 December 2019
The mandalorian captures that powerful Star Wars feeling and excitement and makes you begging to see more.

I'm like it more than I liked the last movies honestly. You can't miss it.

Mandalorian breathes new life into the Star Wars franchise
daniel_b-9609729 November 2019
I have been a huge Star Wars fan ever since I was a young lad ( now 25 years old ) , and I have to say that the Mandalorian absolutely takes the cake for live action tv series! It truly brings out the essence of what the original movies were ! Pure cinema magic! The Mandalorian both has great story while yet leaving many questions unanswered (for now). It also appeals to the fast pace sci-fi action we have come to love from the Star Wars franchise while it also does an incredible job in the more quieter times by drawing on the characters emotions, sense of duty and humanity. The Madalorian also doesn't feel like a cheap spin off. CGI is done with great care and quality, particularly the various alien creatures, (see episode 2). I am extremely excited to see where the Mandalorian goes with its story and I hope it will last for many seasons to come!

Nice looking, but...
cstroeh-848-4760622 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Yes, the first 3 Episodes had some nice moments. Casting Werner Herzog is a stroke of genius, no doubt about it. Everything looks good and "starwarsky". But I still wait for something new. Not just in this series but in the franchise. Everything seems to be constructed in a spreadsheet. First Priority: Fanservice, Fanservice, Fanservice. First Minutes = Snowplanet? How creative! And there is a Cantina? Whoopie! Next a sandy, rocky Planet? Mind blown! Then "Mando" finds another Yoda? You must be kidding.

Nobody in Hollywood seems to have the balls to risk something new. Instead we see Stormtroopers for over 40 years (!) now and look back for 20. But isn't a sci-fi-franchise that always looks back kind of a oxymoron? And frankly I don't give a damn about the troubled childhood of Darth Vader, Han Solo, Boba Fett, etc. Those great villians (and heros) have been completely deconstructed by this uninspired, lazy sloppiness. Thank you very much.

Speaking of lazy sloppiness: Of course most of the "plot" makes no sense. As in many blockbusters today. Why the fight in the cantina? A guy comes in a bar, so what? Sure he want's the Fish-Guy, but thats not the initial reason, right? "Learn to ride a horse, son"? Why not FLY to Sergio-Leone-Town? And what's so special about this superspecial Job? Looks like every 15y-old should be able to find Mini-Yoda. But nobody than Mando can do it? Yeah, sure. Why doesn't the mighty Werner simply send his troops? And shooting at the Rhino does nothing, but stabbing it with a Swiss Army Knife once does the job? Good to know! And can someone please explain to me why Stormtroopers run around in an full-body-armor, when a single shot kills them? I could go on and on...

SW was always about the looks and not soooo much about the story. We loved the planets, the starships, the robots, the monsters. The story was just the glue. Good vs evil, hero's journey, yeah whatever. Some plot twists as the icing on the cake - ok, nice. But give me incredible vistas, strange creatures, exotic languages and cheesy one-liners! It's incredible that this simple formula was enough for decades of entertainment. But for me this slowly comes to an end, especially when you overpaid schmocks can't do more than mix SW with John Wick, Iron Man/Marvel, Spaghetti Western, Leon etc.

Star Wars is back!!!
smnbee-1158619 November 2019
After the disappointment of The Last Jedi, I was apprehensive about a live action TV series, I wasn't expecting it to succeed.

Boy! I'm glad I was wrong.

The titular Mandalorian protagonist (Pedro Pascal) really seems to be faithful to the 'underground phenomenon' of the Mandalorian Culture that exists within Star Wars ("Weapons are part of our religion") that embraces warfare and a code of honour that I really look forward to exploring in future episodes.

My only gripe is that the Episodes seem too short. But that could change.

So far so good, so looking forward to seeing what this has to offer.

If you like the original Star Wars, you will love this!
ian-reynolds-9-98536613 November 2019
A great start to the series, dark, dusty and filled with nostalgic references to the original movies. But in there lies it's problem for some. If you don't know your Star Wars, then you probably won't get 'The Mandalorian'. Beautifully shot and nicely directed with lots of real world puppeteering and no CGI overload. Nicely done, as you would expect, seen as it is a Disney release after all. Is it perfect? No. Not yet, but it is only one episode in so far. Definitely worth watching and probably more than once too. Overall, a great if careful start to what should be a fabulous couple of months of true Star Wars action. Nicely done Disney. And yes, bounty droids rock!!!

Shocking
ekimfreed25 December 2019
I dont understand what's going on with these reviews, there must be some fanatic who has wrote a programme that falsely loads up good reviews for this rubbish. Animatronics are shocking, story lines are boring but he's the worst bounty hunter character in anything ever produced before. He's crap at his job, those little alien things stripped his ship in a few hours for parts and he - do you know what I cant waste a further second of my life reviewing

Hardcore fans only
v-kubilius30 December 2019
To get this out of the way - production quality is really low - it has more of a Muppet Show or Babylon 5 feel than what you would expect from shows in 2019. Acting is so so, plot is unclear or meh, ocassional cut-scene of space or a planet sort of help it, but all in all, I found myself wishing there were more episodes of Mr. Robot or other good series to watch while browsing on my phone with Mandalorian running on the screen... Really not a 8.9/10 experience, unless you are a truly hardcore fan of Star Wars universe and anything related to it is an automatic 10/10 for you.

It would be a 9/10 if Gina Carano wasn't there
dan-14-8776722 December 2019
Calling an MMA fighter an Actress just because she made some other appearances on other action movies where they needed some fight scenes should be illegal. You can actually see her thinking her lines... acting is so poor that I believe it would be easier to teach martial arts to a proper actress and it would still look good... yes she can fight well and probably would kick my arse for saying this, but I think she should stick to fighting or maybe work as a stunt double if she wants to stay in the film industry... it's painful to watch... sorry Gina it's not your fault, it more of the casting director's fault...

Just chaching in on the star war franchise
dalstorp19 December 2019
It's a cheap soap opera in a star wars setting with a prop (baby Joda). As a star war fan I'm disappointed by a bad manuscript, bad acting and almost no connection to star wars.

The animated series STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS had a lot more story and feeling in them, despite being animated.

Jon Favreau does it again
soulsastatic16 November 2019
The man who basically made Ironman amazing has to come back and do the same thing for Star Wars.

I think he envisions Star wars better than George Lucas has for years. Oops. Seriously though, this is the first time since the 80's that I have felt that feeling.

The dialogue especially is perfect, music, the whole feel and just the right amount of comedy.

Bravo Jon Favreau, bravo :)

Watch first episode twice!!
maxwellhaman14 November 2019
At first, I was about disappointed with the acting, and other things, but the second time I watched it, I understood the plot better. My review is better than it was before. The acting is mediocre, the editing at times is trash, the puppeteering for the augnauts mouth and eyebrows bothered me too much, the cgi for the mini dewbacks could be better, the one liners are overused and a bit cheesy, but overall it was not a terrible episode.(keep in mind it's the first), and I do expect a bit better on the second. In the end, it's a decent flick

rowdyguy12412 November 2019
Star Wars fans will not be disappointed with the start of this brand new series. Great CGI, familiar Star Wars tone, new locations and characters. It's even got a new story line. The action movies along almost a little too quickly and could of used a few more minutes to build things up before getting into the final parts of the first episode and the surprises. And of course the stiffness of the characters that we all love/hate from the movies keeps this from shining as bright as top series on other streaming options.

The face is where the acting happens
johnnymonsarrat24 January 2020
How can you have a drama where your protagonist always wears a mask? That's where the face is. That's where the acting happens.

The characters in this series didn't engage me at all. I don't know why it's okay to kill Jawas that stole from you. Or why the Mandalorians would rally support even though one of them "broke the rules". We get a repeat of the worst part of Star Wars VI, when primitive people with sticks take down elite troops with guns.

adriankruger-5508614 January 2020
When you watch this there's no sense of it being part of the Star Wars franchise. Why oh why did they not use the epic and emotionally stirring original themes. Instead they use knock off Rocky music and in action scenes I keep thinking of Rocky Balboa training! The best bit is super cute baby Yoda.

Star Wars in style of Disney's princesses
newday-172-26142713 January 2020
Honestly I was shocked when I saw first and second episodes but let's be honest as each episode goes on it got more childish and story got dull and duller.

Also there was few unnecessary episode in between which did not make any senses. Like the one about Empire's spaceship prison.

And the final episode of season one was a disaster. Everything about it was unbelievable. The CGI, story, acting, ending,... Its was a mass disaster.

Still fun to watch but expect Star Wars in style of Disney's princesses.

Hey Disney! That lava river and those mice was horrible. Also I could not stand repeating of Mando's childhood memories anymore in nearly every episodes.

phillipshannah7912 January 2020
Never have I ever had any desire to watch any of the Star Wars movies until the Mandalorian.

Not sure if it has to to with the absolute adorableness of Baby Yoda(aka The Child), Pedro Pascal, the soundtrack itself , most likely everything combined. But I looked forward to an episode every week, and actually wanted to get through Christmas to see how things went down.

My only complaint is we were only blessed with eight episodes the first season and have to wait til next fall for the new season.

This is just pure greatness!
alisinank12 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
Not only is this the best TV series of a famous universe it actually delivers. Although without a great story, the series keeps the drama and action alive throughout its episodes. The cast choices are wonderful, Pedro Pascal like all his other works, kills his role even though you don't see his face for most of the series. Acting although wonky at times, is enjoyable, nothing was god awful. The settings, costumes and the CGI is top notch, you never feel the disappointing low budget production of some of the other popular TV series. Dialogues are fun especially the storm troopers, also their ability to hit something with a blaster is mocked 4th wall engagement woot! The score is also amazing. This might and probably is the best thing after the acquisition of SW universe by Disney. I hope they keep this up!

The Last Hope, it is...
patrickfilbeck11 January 2020
After 4 failed films and with Rogue One an obvious hit, Disney tries to listen to the fans...and succeeds with it. The Mandalorian shows that it is obviously possible to bring atmosphere and the right feeling into this small scale action flick series. We see the creation of new cult characters and at the same time value what has already been created and, at the same time, are witnesses to the valuation of the Franchise.

Ignore the closet critics of Star Wars. They take them selves far too seriously. This is an amazing and most importantly fun and enjoyable mini series to watch. Visual effects were very good and although I hate cgi generally, I was actually very impressed with how good the effects overall were.

...And who can resist baby Yoda, I mean seriously he is the cutest thing I've ever seen.....

siddharth-shakyau10 January 2020
Even if you're not a hardcore Starwars fan and don't understand the timelines of the movies released over the decade, this series holds it's own pretty well and is really good starter point for new potential fans who have heard the lore of starwars and wanna jump on the action. Pedro pascal is a phenomenal actor just like he was in Narcos & GoT. The Mandalorian lays the foundation of where the starwars universe and characters fall in.

And yes Baby Yoda is super cute as well :)

With only 1 average episode the first season was great and I can't wait for more.

Your not really into the original star wars!!!
kobsingh29 December 2019
Bad reviews about this show, must have come from those who never came out of the cinema in 1977 after watching A new hope, thinking this is the best sci-fi film ever made. And also feeling that after the following 2 films that came out in 1980 and 1983 that nothing could be better than this. It has been decades in the waiting for anything with the star wars stamp on it too actually feel like Star wars. And now that time has come. If your looking for perfection, you will not find that, but what you will find is a show that will give you a nostalgic feel and the hope that anyone connected to Star wars will continue to develop upon this, as a strong foundation for future Star wars projects that ooze the essence of what Stars wars gave to youngsters in the late 70s and 80s. I HAVE SPOKEN!!!

9 out of 10 because the episodes are a little short i thing 45 min episodes would do it a little more justice. It brings alot to the star wars mythos without destroying anything. This is what we wanted out of the main story line. I cant wait to see a 2 part edit of it all together.

I was a little skeptical during the first episode. Some of the side characters had some pretty bad acting, but once you get a few episodes in it's pretty hard to put down. It's a really nice refreshing addition to the star wars universe.

Batman_8828 December 2019
I wouldn't call myself a big Star Wars fan, I have seen some of the movies but not all of them. However I enjoyed this show and find myself wanting to know more about the Star Wars universe.

Each episode is exciting and I haven't come across one I didn't like. This first season would be 10 from me if the episodes were longer. I think they are too short as most tv shows run for 45-60min episodes. For this reason I give it a 9.

MarvinLeroy27 December 2019
First of all, the series is great and leads up to an absolute fantastic final. Some episodes are not as good as the rest of the show, which explains the 9 out of 10, but they all add up together. The scenery is beautiful and gives the viewer a long forgotten Star Wars vibe. The story is innovative and does not copy anything else from the SW universe as for example the sequel trilogy did. I am really looking forward to the next season!

What Star Wars could have been
rjwcs22 December 2019
Its says something when the spin offs of Rogue One and The Mandalorian are far superior than the full feature films. The Mandalorian is made with love instead of contempt, its is based on narrative instead of beating you over the head with politics, and its characters are flawed and grow and learn on the journey instead of starting up as perfect and not having any barriers then can't surpass alone and with ease. The Mandalorian trips, he misses, he gets punched, he gets hurt, he fails, and behind his unremoved helmet he is more human than Anakin and Rey. Some might say it is not a perfect 10 compared to other series, a run of the mill western style shooter, but no one was ever asking for perfection. The art style fits. The series mixes CGI, animatronics and movie sets seamlessly so its all blends together and doesn't distract you from the story telling. The story is not very original but it is told without pretension. Loyalty, betrayal, redemption and resolution. Simple and effective. No more could be asked. The environment feels true and alive, as much as a series can make it so. The love and detail put into the sets and costumes screams Star Wars. The concept art shown at the end of each episode is fossil proof of it.

This is all that fans where hoping for and proof that their expectations were not unrealistic and a projection of false nostalgia. It can be done right and it has been done right with The Mandalorian. I pray the success of the 1st season is not used up as a Trojan horse to re-inject into the 2nd season all that was wrong with the 3 last SW movies.

Visually stunning and tense
lachlans-3217820 December 2019
The Mandalorian follows the story of a lone bounty hunter who experiences some troubles when he is faced with a serious question, money or a child's life. Mando is an incredible character and his development throughout the show is incredible. The combat scenes, both short and long range, are truly incredible and are the true shining star of the show. If you watch for Baby Yoda then I'm sure your still going to be hooked on this show. The visuals are truly stunning and the anticipation between episodes for me grows every week. With the last episode nearing I'm sure to update this review and rant about how good it closes out

this is a good enteraining show, but there are so drawbacks
pandabear-8960918 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I love baby yoda so that brings it from 7 to an 8..... now the reason i'm saying there are some drawbacks from the show is that it's almost the same episode every time, but different people involved. it goes something like this.... mando takes a job, everything seems to be going ok with job, but people are acting sketchy. they end up betraying mando. somehow he ends up getting the upper hand. he defeats them and then gets his bounty (or doesn't sometimes) and then he goes on his way. why he keeps taking jobs knowing this happens every single time? i'll never know. the show is enjoyable fun though, but i just hope for a bit more in the next few episodes and future seasons. it still feels like there is no point to this show. i don't know what it's leading to at all. the yoda baby is going to stay a baby because it takes years to get older, way longer than mando's life.... so yeah idk what the whole point of the show is, but i'll cotinue to watch anyways because it's fun.

Plastic
baardkristiansen16 December 2019
Beeing a life long lover and entusiast of the galaxy far far away franchise, i cant help but think that....with disney behind with pockets deep of cash... it seems to me that they could spend alittle on good looking locations. It looks like the inside of ships and houses is made of shiney plastic. I want to go into the screen and knock it over. The story of a bodyhunter trveling the galaxy picking up stray work, is to me thin at best. The caracters wardrobe allso seems cheap. The only thing i like in this story is that damn cute baby yoda, ant his way of using the force in a very cute way. And he does not seem to understand what is happening when the force fixes all kind of situations. He just gogoing away at his own choice. This series need better writers and it would not be my first choice if somebody would ask me what star wars saga is the best. Do better Disney

I'm really loving this. 2 episodes in. Love the style, script and feel. Not gonna get all geeky but I'm 58 years old and grew up with SW. blah, blah. I know its probably cgi but certain scenes even look like they've got the old matte backgrounds in. Love the edgy anti hero script. Loads of nods to the "goox ol days" And the original Ralph Macquarie design is also in there. Plus the post credits R.M. style renderings. BRILLIANT.

Only three episodes in and it keeps getting better and better! This feels like the original Star Wars. It is full of of heart, great writing, and makes you want to root for the good in all of us. Jon Favreau is a master when it comes to directing and pulling his audience in. Can't wait to see the rest.

Beware the jetpack!
lojack8422 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I have seen up to episode 3 and based on what I have seen this show is fantastic.

Finally a Star Wars show that feels like and looks like the Star Wars I knew growing up, this is the first time i've felt excited about the franchise in a long time.

I loved the original Trilogy and felt the prequel series was a big swing but a huge miss, adding so much CGI that it lost the charm and vibe the originals had. I was pleasantly surprised by Rogue One and utterly dissapointed with the Sequels. (What they did to Luke was just unforgiveable and such a wasted opportunity).

Now here we have Mandalaorian, it's a smaller story, on a smaller scale, with a smaller cast and yet it is HUGELY entertaining, the costume design, world building and charactors so far have been a joy to spend time with and the baby yoda may well be the most adorable charactor the Star Wars universe has ever seen, and i'm not usually a softie!

Mandalorian makes the most out of using old tech and new CGI to create something that engulfs your imagination. I for one can't wait to see where this show is going, and I can only hope there will be more like it.

Nothing special, but watchable.
eddmclev21 November 2019
This is probably your dream series if you are Star wars fan. For someone like me it was watchable but pretty short. A lot of action, no meaningless chat and straight to the point plot. I will keep watching this to see where it leads.

Every bit as great as it needs to be.
plex18 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Glad to see Favreau has come into his own, rode it out, and is now getting(hopefully) the control he deserves. This is without a doubt, the best adjunct to the Star Wars I have seen, even eclipsing Rogue One, this is my favorite installment since The Empire Strikes Back. Jon has assembled a great team around his vision and script, and seemingly, Disney has bestowed some autonomy upon him. The Mandalorian pulled me in from the very first scene and has not let go, a true pleasure to watch and absorb, that is in line with the ambience of Episodes 4 & 5, perfectly paced, shot, edited, with great voice over, talent and production values. Music score,IMO, is the only less-than-stellar aspect of the this series so far. Its bet feature is that it does not insult the audience with needless childish gags, or overworked convoluted explanations. This will appeal to kids and adults. I particularly love the re-introduction and acknowledgment of some of the peripheral characters like that annoying pet of Jaba nestled in his tail, now getting roasted while its like-specie's is forced to watch in horror. Other "beings" from A New Hope like Jawas and service droids. This is one of those rare times I actually am eager to see the next episode. At just $6 a month, Disney has offered far more than HBO does at $15. Hmm, who knows, maybe my faith in Disney is restored?

True Star Wars
mjritch18 November 2019
Not only is the design aesthetic of this show practical and extremely well-made, not only is the show quality cinematic in it's formatting to live action television but the storytelling is top notch and this show manages to capture the heart, spirit and essence of the original trilogy first brought to life by George Lucas. The new innovative tech used in editing and enhancing the special effects in the creation of the Mandalorian's world is insane to behold and the show itself lends a third world perspective from a galaxy far, far away not yet seen except in Clone Wars and Rebels. The ratings of the series are great so far and the show is already a massive hit with audiences only having two episodes appearing on Disney +, so far. Showrunner Jon Favreau and executive Dave Filoni have created something truly awe-inspiring and is a worthy addition to the Star Wars canon.

9.4/10 as of the premiere of the first two episodes dropping on the new streaming service.

The Musical Score is Kinda Cheesey but...
JamesAlvarez52018 November 2019
John Williams is a HUGE part of Star Wars. His work on the original Star Wars films is iconic to say the least. I didn't expect Williams to score the Mandalorian, but I at least expected something that would emulate his style. Most of the music on the show is cheesey and somewhat distracting from an otherwise outstanding series. However, it's not a deal breaker. This series is exceeding most of my expectations and is quickly becoming my new favorite show. So, I'll give the bad score a free pass since the rest of the show is so good.

Shockingly good Star Wars universe story
e-8871418 November 2019
You know, this movie looks so dated, childish and retroish... And I LOVE IT! Hands down, best "space-opera" stylization. Is it a Real Star Wars? NO. This one much better. One star off for Disney. Hate Disney. Pray for John Favreau and Dave Filoni!

An early word after having seen 2 episodes
go_titans17 November 2019
Star Wars needs great story, intelligent writing and great imagination. These three things are what the original trilogy (IV, V, VI) were built on.

Episodes I, II, III also had these three factors, but they are delivered badly. Episode VII was so lacking in story, intelligence and imagination that I didn't even bother to watch the Last Jedi...Abrams had successfully managed to kill off any interest I had in the continuing of that story.

But I loved Rogue One and Solo. In fact, I was astonished. They had story, intelligence and imagination in abundance, plus they were delivered well, so I honestly don't understand why so many people were unhappy.

And so now we come to the Mandalorian. A TV series for Star Wars?! This already threatens the first of the three needed things: a great story. What weekly series has ever told as gripping a story as the original Star Wars trilogy? Having said that, if this proves to be only a mini series then there might still be some hope for it.

So far, the story presented in the first two episodes comes across like a typical western in some ways, and so it continues to worry me that this will become a pointless 'Days of Our Lives' look at the Star Wars universe.

I'm also sorry to say I really don't like the music, there's nothing special about it at all. And some reviewers here have commented on how interesting the main character is, which I find to be quite puzzling. We can't see his face, and he has hardly said anything riveting so far, so I don't really see anything interesting about him yet.

I'm also a bit worried about the intelligence of the script. Our hero is told he needs to learn to ride a particular beast in order to reach a certain place, but in the end we discover that he could just as easily have walked there. You then realise that the script writers were simply trying to fill out the show's run time and had nothing else to go with. This is what worries me.

So to sum up, the Mandelorian is nowhere near as good as Star Wars at its best but it's way better than Star Wars at its worst, so I'll give it a 7 and hope that they don't turn it into another 'Days of Our Lives' style series like Star Trek. If they keep it short, say...8 episodes maximum, it may deliver on one of the core requirements of any good Star Wars installment - a truly worthwhile story. But if it drags on and the overall story gets forgotten as we focus on the main character going from town to town shooting bad guys, then for me I think this will become another nail in the coffin of the franchise.

About as perfect as it could be. A real return to the original trilogy feel. Not cramming action and humor down our throats as fast as possible, but a real journey . Well done.

The music of this show is messing with my mind. I dont what is it about it but there is certainly some weirdness to it and offputting or some mystery to it like as if we are only hearing 1/4th of it. Also i have no clue where this show is going and i love it! Are they retconing the Jedi?

Excellent Star Wars Bounty Hunter Story (so far)
paulgts-114 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I'm not going to go over why it's good in my opinion. Instead I'm going to address a few of the issues I've seen people bringing up in reviews, this won't make those people like it but maybe they might understand the reasons for it and give it another chance.

Despite what some reviewers say there is plenty of story there, plenty of depth but it's not gong to be immediately obvious to anyone who isn't a Star Wars nerd (no offense but just growing up and loving the original trilogy doesn't qualify you to be a Star Wars nerd anymore). Favreau has catered specifically to fans of the original Star Wars and more so to Boba Fett fans but has added a layer of depth you'll only find if you've delved deeper into more of the official canon. Like it or not that's who it's aimed at and they love it (myself included). Understand that and give it a chance and maybe you'll find a lot more in the remaining episodes.

I am a Star Wars nerd, a Vader fan above all else but also I loved Boba Fett as a child watching ESB in the early 80's.

The Helmet - People sight a lack of personality and believe the show will be terrible if he does not take off the helmet. There might be some merit in what they are saying but this show, The Madalorian is based on Boba Fett, you never see Boba take off his helmet in the movies, it's just a voice of a cold hard Bounty Hunter. Vader didn't take his helm off for the entire original trilogy except for a very short scene right at the end and is regarded as one of the best cinema villains of all time. His movements and actions courtesy of David Prowse and voice courtesy of James Earl Jones gave him plenty of personality all throughout the trilogy (if you wanted to see it).

The Shoulder Pad (pauldron) - People have complained it's all about buying a shoulder pad (which it isn't). There is a 100% justifiable reason for this being a large part of this first episode. Mandalorian armour, the suit that Boba Fett wore (as well as Jango in the prequels) is THE best armour in the Star Wars galaxy. It is made from Beskar Steel (also known as Mandalorian Iron) and can withstand a slashing/glancing strike from a lightsaber (maybe they should've extended the pauldrons up slightly to protect necks like old medieval knights and Jango wouldn't have been decapitated).

As a result of being able to withstand some lightsaber blows it is understandably very sought after and very rare. The empire controlled most of it and so it is a fitting way for the client to tempt this Mandalorian Bounty Hunter to carry out such a dangerous and frankly dodgy (the lack of a Bounty Puck, competing Assassin Droid with contradictory orders and the morality of the target only being discovered at the end). The scene with the Mandalorian blacksmith forging it was also quite interesting as it demonstrates that the Mandalorians are still around, they refer to their clan and foundlings.

It's spot on, my only gripe and the reason episode 1 did not earn an 8 or 9 star rating from me was that 37 minutes is incredibly short for a premium subscription show. I saw it at a friends place and that length won't convince me to pay for Disney Plus, that being said I gave it a slightly generous 8 instead of a 7 because I want to support the series and ratings are key, in my opinion they've made a good (if not short) pilot here and I want them to see that reflected in the ratings, fortunately that seems to be the case overall.

Let's hope the momentum can be maintained! Plus a baby Yoda what's not to like? A lot of paid critics have been totally harsh on this first episode, which is unwarranted. I really don't know what they were expecting but it ticked the boxes for me. I can't wait for the next episode.

Lone Wolf & Cup Rip Off for Star Wars nerds
pckq8 February 2020
The story of the Mandalorian is basically lifted from the japanese manga Lone Wolf and Cup. Its not very nice to steal, is it? However the direction here is pretty solid. Everything smells like Star Wars. And Baby Yoda alone is worth watching through The Mandalorian. Despite being a rip off, this show is still light-years better than any of the embarrassing JJ Abrams flicks.

mbell-562148 February 2020
You can tell Disney have got their hands on this. It's a bit to light weight and fluffy for my tastes. No real depth to the stories, with each episode feeling like it's been pushed off a conveyor belt of mainstream story telling. With so many cable channels producing some excellent shows, this will have to be marked as, average and should do better.

kshutch-165908 February 2020
All future Star Wars need to use this as a model. It feels more serious and a bit darker than the movies, but it also has a simplicity that only the original 3 movies had. There is mystery and action and a great storyline. There were a few episodes I felt were more like filler. I hope they stray away from doing that in the next season and just stick to the main arc. This show is definitely worth watching.

Interesting (S1), but not that much...
ivobg8 February 2020
Warning: Spoilers
Am I the only one who didn't liked the music/?? Honestly - I think the soundtrack was awful, it was monotone, annoying at some moments, and it wasn't giving me the Star Wars feeling. it sounded like a cheap soapy cowboy series music. Yeah, Mando appears to be some sort of a "space cowboy", riding its "space horse" kickin' bad guys arses here and there, protecting the innocent and stuff... But I really hope S2 gets much better soundtrack!

Too short episodes with not much plot or characters development - random meetings with random people on random planets. One can get the feeling that the "baby Yoda" is the leading character, not The Mandalorian. Little creature's life was more important than any of the season's characters. They could easily called this show "The Little Yoda".

Acting was good. Not brilliant but good. Pity some of them had to die early in the show. IG-11 droid could have been a great companion for Mando, but at least he wasn't wasted as Snoke or Phasma, for comparison... Gina Carano's character was cute, I really thought Cara will fell in love with Mando and will join his crew. But that may still happen, who knows...

One thing baffles me - how come the little creature was 50 years old but couldn't speak a word? Kinda weird...

Anyways - Season 1 was good and entertaining, and it ended promising. 7/10

Good space-fi series? "This is the way."
GerryofNorVA30 January 2020
"The Mandalorian" (8eps, 1/2hr, Dis+) is a decent spa-fi series based in the Star Wars universe, 5yrs after SW VI. To be clear, The Mandalorian was at first suspected to be about Boba Fett; in fact, his name is actually Din Djarin, no relation. And Baby Yoda is just a colloquialism, same species as Yoda but no name, and fairly poor, low budget animatronics, too, especially since much of the action is due to the protection of that character. Look, there's a lot to like about this first season and a lot to poke at it about, but on balance, I found it to be a decent ride, I looked forward to each episode, and will watch S02, but I'm not calling this a great series at this point. I believe each episode had a different director, too, so you don't get a consistent experience and you'll find some episodes better than others. That model is fine for discrete story episodes but this is serialized so it should have more consistent/cohesive writing and direction, maybe next season.

cute family show, but riddled with more plot holes than your average mandalorian
pcp-3827825 January 2020
If you are looking for a star wars show that you can show your 13 year old kid, look no further. The characters have a clear good/evil alignment, the episodes are short and require not much thinking, and the music will tell you in every scene how you are supposed to feel. The bad guys are bad at shooting, but as soon as they turn to the good side they are marksmen. There is lots of plot armor to go around and the most of the ones dying have literally never shown their faces.

On the negative side there is e.g. that in the first few episodes Mando is hunting someone, and gets surprised by that someone and drops his blaster before having a fist fight. Time and time again. Even against animals. At many times it feels like they started with a computer game and turned it into a TV show. The power level of the characters change at random. In one scene a character is capable of killing ~40 enemies on his own, while being shot at. 10 minutes later there is no possible way that the same character can - with help from others - kill 15 enemies. The decisions that ppl take are sometimes ridiculous, but necessary for the plot to happen the way it does. The music is overwhelming and at times tries to turn a neutral scene into being suspenseful.

Finally!
Tikibongo25 January 2020
I remember being young and craving for more star wars. We all just couldn't believe there would ever be another star wars movie. Then Lucas comes with the prequels, exhibiting that he had no clue what was inside the heart of a star wars fan. Then came those ugly, fragmented sequels. With that crap of a movie TLJ. I'll never forget the shame I felt being a star wars fan. Damaging to the cannon..Too bad. Luckily Edwards came along and got to make Rogue One, great movie, feels star wars, giving us hope. Solo, no star wars feel there but nice movie overall. And then.. The Mandalorian.. finally I feel like I'm back in that familiar world, in my youth. And still so much new vibes. Filoni and Favreau nailed it! Excellent! Could it be Disney has a learning curve? They have to. In an era of internet, one can not just sell any story anymore, one needs to collaborate with the crowd. Or loose their attention.. A lesson learned so it seems.. now you may proceed.. with caution..

I liked Critical Drinkers summary on this show
algalkin22 January 2020
Its like a half-decent lunch at the local pub - even better with a beer or two. But not much than that. I guess all the 10 star reviews are from people who never ate better than that. Especially in comparison to sequel trilogy's still warm turd, I'd agree. If you like your shows to have the depth and good character development, stay away from this one. I'd give it 5 stars for special effects and support roles cast but I have to counter all the undeserved 10 star "reviews".

A New Hope
CriticalOfEverything20 January 2020
The Mandalorian, while far from perfect, is a pretty good show that might just be the saving grace that Star Wars needs. After the movies continued to disappoint in ways previously thought unimaginable, with some of them being even worse than the prequels, we get a TV show that feels fresh. Which is strange, as the show doesn't exactly do anything that hasn't been done before. That's also my main issue with it, but for Star Wars, it's just what the franchise needed. No more bloated, overwhelming CGI, no overstuffed and horribly paced stories, no gaping plot holes, and no over-reliance on nostalgia (although there is still some of that but not to the extent of the sequel trilogy). It's a solid, well-designed, decently written and competently acted ride that contains a few surprises but not much else that could be considered new. It's simple, but effective. I hope Season 2 improves on the aspects that limited Season 1 and that we can have something that truly rivals the original trilogy, but this is still a fun and comfortable watch from start to finish (minus episodes 4 and 5).

Please have a story and mature characters
paulomarcosf19 January 2020
The serie is very good in terms of the StarWars environment, using much of the old movies. The story started very well but then in the middle started losing focus. Episode 8 is crazy because is made of a series of nonsenses. The problem of most of the movies today is that things happen at great speed and the story and the characters don't have time to mature and to pass feelings to the audience. In this case is worst because the main character has a helmet and a monotone voice. What is the idea?! Please give time for drama and feelings, space for relationship. Action is not all that matters. A good story and mature and emphatic characters is the key. All the rest is there. Take out the helmet and make all characters more human.

More of Disney Star Wars
realmuthaf16 January 2020
I honestly don't get the sudden praise for this, especially amidst bashing of the latest "Star Wars" feature. Like Disney's movies, this product survives only on endless references to Lucas' two trilogies (mainly the old one, as aging brainless nerds are still catered to), but brings nothing new to the franchise and doesn't expand it in any way.

Plot-wise, the Mandalorian is empty. Filled with cheesy lines, each episode is a package of played-out filmmaking cliches - the hardened warrior having feelings all of a sudden, the noble protagonist joining a band of misfits "for one last job" and getting betrayed, etc. The story is structured like that of an old bad videogame - the protagonist gets a quest from an NPC (you need to capture the kid - you need to free a prisoner - you need to help the peasants, the list goes on), completes it and gets a quest from another, the story doesn't unfold on its own in any major way. A few paragraphs could be dedicated to the stupidity of both supporting and the titular characters, to how dumbly he falls into any trap laid before him, and how he tries to be a badass in one scene only to be beaten up in another, but this is getting too long anyway.

Finally, I don't understand the necessity of Pedro Pascal's involvement. The titular character never shows his face, and playing him doesn't require any acting abilities, you just read the lines blandly. IMDb's trivia even says that he doesn't appear on screen at all in episode 1, it's all body doubles. I would just fire him and save some budget.

I've read people say "this finally has the right vibe". The only thing likening this to the old movies is how cheap it looks compared to modern feature films.

Good, with some minor points
vandijkvalentijn14 January 2020
A good series; it's a solid canon in the Star Wars universe. In my opinion the amount of action was a bit disappointed with regards to the first three star wars movies (IV, V and VI). The special effects are good and it's well-written and well-directed. A series worth watching, but if you are a hardcore Star Wars fan who likes all the lightsaber duels and action, don't get your hopes up too high.

Average at best...
leoalshannag13 January 2020
I cannot believe the imdb score this show has. Also the user reviews, there are way too many biased people giving this show too high scores.

It really is a mediocre show. Stupid people will fall for the Star Wars world, and baby Yoda, who was only created to sell merchandise. Where is baby Yoda in the new movies? If the Mandalorian is supposed to take place between the fall of the Empire and the rise of the First Order, why not even a mention in the movies? Because they are just making stuff up to sell a crappy product. And stupid people keep buying it!

Whoever thinks this show is GREAT, needs to take a good look at themselves. At best, it is an OK show...and that is stretching it. Just a bunch of hollow Star Wars fans, that weren't even born when Phantom Menace came out, will give this show 10/10. Do you know what 10/10 implies??

The production value is cheap. I cannot believe this is a Disney produced show that is based on the world of Star Wars. It looks really bad at times, and the dialogue is childish. It has the same problem as the Witcher series, the production value looks cheap even though the shows have a high budget.

I am an unbiased reviewer. I enjoy Star Wars, but not a hardcore fan (cannot understand the hype to be honest). But I do enjoy a well produced movie/show, like the original trilogy of Star Wars which were good, but not as good as people make them to be. I like the Beatles, but if the Beatles tried to make it today then they would not even get a contract. It is all a matter of who was first, the Beatles were among the first to sing in that manner, that is why they are remembered (and overhyped), nothing special about them except being first. Just like the original Star Wars trilogy. They were first to present a somewhat realistically shot story of wars in space, with a good story. And let's not forget, the old trilogy was released when space travel was really a big thing in America, and around the world. Imagine them releasing a good Fortnite movie right now, I believe it would make a lot of money...but in the future when one looked back at why it made so much, we would be able to see that the topics trend was at its peak during release.

We think that we are the ones that made the Beatles famous, or Star Wars, but that is not the case. We get bombarded everyday about things that, "they" think is great. If all the critics keep saying, "This is great you have to watch it", then people will believe that even if it is not that great. In other words, to sell more products of many things the industry is ready to lie about how good a product is, this is nothing new in the consumer world. Movies and music are just consumer products, with the only thing in mind when produced is; how much money can we make? And if people keep thinking, the Mandalorian is the "BEST SHOW EVER ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET AND THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY!!!", then they will keep producing these mediocre shows that hardcore fans think they are great...wake up people!

Better content than the movies but in the end it's just the same old waiting game
williamsteenstra9 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
It's good, but it's not 'I'm going to wait for the 'second season to premiere in late 2020' good'. I suspect that the makers of Star Wars expect us to believe that it takes a year to create the special effects for a lightsaber to turn on.

Story, characters, acting, script, and cgi are all solid I'd say 8-9/10 there was some pacing issues and a couple lines of dialog that may be forced or kinda lame but not enough to even make me roll my eyes or anything. The people saying there isn't a story haven't finished it yet. It connects everything and sets up the story for the following seasons. Episodes 1-6 pretty much are episodic but set up the characters and the universe that this show will be set in. The fight scenes are cool and I like how the main character actually gets hit with blasters. But the characters, acting and script keep you interested in the first few episodes and make them enjoyable. I'm very excited for season 2.

Great Star Wars entry
jwwalrath-227-8548730 December 2019
The show is a about a Mandalorian bounty hunter (voiced by Pedro Pascal) who finds things taking a turn when he takes the assignment to retrieve a mysterious individual. This is just a fantastic work of television!

This show looks great. It costs 15 mil per episode and definitely looks it. It has the original Star Wars trilogy appearance with a wild Wild West feel. There are a handful of great visual decisions. Also, I don't want to spoil anything but be sure to see the ending credits.

The music is really, really good. Again blending Star Wars and the Wild West.

There is just some really good dialogue. Though this is a more serious SW entry like Rogue One, it also has some decent humorous lines. Since the titular Mandalorian is a man of few words, this is one of those shows that can do a lot with a little dialogue in parts.

Though the cast is mostly just the Mandalorian, we get an excellent rotation of likable characters and actors. You may see some faces you'll recognize and won't suspect. It's especially refreshing to see Carl Weathers (Rocky, Predator) back in the spotlight as the head of the mercenary guild.

There are a couple things that appear to be an issue for several people online. First off: though the show does have a narrative through line, there is a heavy emphasis on episodic stories. I guess some people who saw the trailers were expecting one big epic tale and were disappointed. Personally, I didn't mind as they were entertaining stories. Although, I wouldn't have appreciated a little more revelation for a mysteries that was introduced early on. (I hate it when we have questions all season long and realize we have to wait until at least another season for answers.) The finale serves as a pretty strong wrap-up.

Second: Short episode length, 30-43 min. Admittedly, it'd be nice to have more Star Wars content, but it's nice that the show is straight-to-the-point and doesn't feel like it's trying to fill time.

There are a couple other issues. There are two times where a couple story elements feel like straight up copies of existing western/samurai films. Also, there is an aspect of Mandalorian culture in this that seems to conflict with how we've seen them portrayed in Star Wars Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels without explanation. The fact that Dave Filoni, the showrunner of the two shows, is an executive producer, director, and writer on this which makes the difference even more surprising.

Jon Favreau (director of Iron Man and the recent Jungle Book) created this and he really brings his A-game. This is a highly entertaining, fairly quick watch, and I highly recommend this.

I've seen them all and I like this one a lot!
SnowmanCan29 December 2019
It's a much simpler approach to all the Galaxy-wide story lines of previous SW productions. Of course a lot goes unexplained. Of course characters have vulnerabilities. And it feels more real, like Rogue and Solo. For a streaming series, there's a lot to it.

A masterpiece that made me forget my phone
yasinnam29 December 2019
When rating films and series I watch at home, I have one simple rule to distinguish a mediocre series from a masterpiece. If my phone rings and I don't answer it, it is probably the latter. "The Mandalorian" did just that. From the story writing to the acting, visual effects, editing, costume design, cinematography, sound editing & mixing. This series surprised me in a way that I could not have imagined myself. A work of art that exceeded even my highest expectations.

Yes, at first glance, the episodes may seem a bit short, but in the end it doesn't really matter. They are exactly as long as they need to be. It feels just right.

It's just the right amount of nostalgia. Something the new trilogy couldn't give me. Don't get me wrong, nostalgia is not what makes the series so good, the show is incredible on its own! It's just the cherry on top. It's what makes the show "complete". It's what makes it a must-see for any die-hard Star Wars fan.

Only one thing left to say to the makers of this show:

"This is the way."

Amazing Show!!!
udana-fonseka29 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This is the best Star Wars material I have experienced since the original trilogy.

A brilliant space western with the right dose of Star Wars, Action, Sc-Fi, Western, Drama delivered through Great Characters, Visuals and Music. I would pay to watch this show in a theater. A fresh breath of air and quite a relief to feel that Star Wars universe will survive and thrive in the form of this show.

If you love the original trilogy, it is a nostalgic show with an authentic "Star Wars" feel. If you are new to Star Wars, this will probably be the best Star Wars material you will experience as a much enjoyable high quality standalone Space Western, Action, Sci-Fi. Drama! If you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop or Serenity, you will probably love this.

Excellent job by Jon Favreau and the team!

Oh yes, Best Star Wars Series i have ever seen.
viggodahlin29 December 2019
I absolutely love this serie, it's full of excitement and star wars feelings. Now i'm too lazy to do a full review covering why i love it so much but there is actually a few problems with this serie but nothing big. The 6th episode you can LITERALLY skip cause that episode was pure crap, i mean the acting, plot holes, Nothing made any sense that they changed the characters all the time, plus no story progression. So i'm just a little bit upset about the 6th episode, that it went to waste but otherwise a great star wars serie, really looking forward to season 2. 9/10 "I have spoken."

Promising
lovefalloutkindagamer29 December 2019
Been a fan of star wars games, films and now this tv show. It's not perfect, and honestly my favorite episodes were the first 2 as they felt so much like star wars - yet bizarrely /other/ at the same time. As the show progressed, it lost some of that while we also lose any resemblance of a plot after episode 3 til episode 7, and that did bother me as I waited weekly for the ridiculously short episodes. All in all, I am so glad to have something be cool with the star wars name and not be about jedi - we direly needed a break from them with all the inner turmoil within the fanbase caused by the recent films.

8/10 would recommend to anyone

This is some of the best science-fiction to come along in a long time. It requires some brain power but also is very pleasant on the eye. The storyline intrigues me and I eagerly await the releases. Best science fiction since The Expanse.

Not a Star Wars fan, but can't lie, this was awesome 8.5/10
ibibrov28 December 2019
Having never been a fan of Star Wars, and absolutely loathing the new movies, with their blatant political agenda pushing, flat, boring characters, and just overall flopped, I still decided to give The Mandalorian a try..and was I glad I did..this is what Star Wars should be like, a western-like, fun, mysterious romp. No feminist, childish young girls as protagonists, no cashing in on people's nostalgia, just original writing, interesting and charismatic characters, incredible cinematography, beautiful soundtrack, and just great all around. My favourite part of this show was the Mandalorian himself, his dark, murky past, and taciturn, cold exterior with a soft, feeling heart underneath, and then the relationship between him and baby Yoda, and his character arc to becoming a father. Amazing stuff. I love Pedro Pascal's ability to tell show much without revealing his face, and having a very emotive voice, and body language helped a hella lot too.. excited to see what the upcoming seasons bring..for me, 8.5/10

A Well Thought Out Series That Is Worth Watching
zhenwenho28 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The season just wrapped and my gosh what a blast it was following this series every week. First off I would like to get the negatives out of the way in which what is and the most obvious thing is, filler episodes, true, they serve the ultimatum of the series but the issue is such that these side characters are given approximately 7 minutes of screentime within that episode and then doesn't show up until 5 episodes later on. I understand that it is the way it is supposed to be but the series really dipped upon reaching episode 4 and 5 and it almost lost my interest. One episode that I must criticize would be episode 5 where the side characters were simply just annoying and they didn't even show up in later episodes. Furthermore, the acting was subpar within that episode and the episode ended up feeling like a CW DC tv show. I still stand by my initial comment where I stated that the initial episodes for this series would've been a lot nicer if they were longer as it would've allowed the audience to really settle into this world which is very much the Star Wars universe but it is fairly grounded as compared to a fleet of planet killing star destroyers.

On with the positives now, Pedro Pascal absolutely killed it as the main where he is forced to rely on his body language and his intonation when he speaks to convey emotion. Another was that for the main side characters that got through up until episode 8, they were really interesting, could be more interesting but hey, I'll take this over the rise of skywalker on any given day. And yes, this is a far more satisfying view compared to the rise of skywalker (at least the story is linear). Baby yoda is adorable, I want a toy of him he is so cute and smol and fluffy and old? Uh, weird species but yeah. The cgi is pretty good for what it's worth actually and I didn't expect it to be of that high quality judging by the fact that well it's a tv show well a streamed series to be exact but yeah. Another strong positive would be that each character has a well thought out arc where the mandalorian starts to care and trust, a rebel shock trooper getting back up or even a yeah you get what I mean. Plus, the season finale was amazing.

dekmax28 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I rarely write reviews but this warrants one. Just finished episode 8 last night and this morning still talking about it with the girlfriend.

Great characters, brilliant storyline, baby Yoda, superb Soundtrack, I could go on.

I was automatically hooked and thank you so much I feel this is what Star Wars fans were hoping with the new movies, but since they gloriously messed that up with dumb morals and SJW angles this show is total redemption

I can't say enough and having Carl Weathers, Werner Herzog, Giancarlo Esposito, Nick Nolte and f'ing Bill Burr in this just made it that much better.

THIS, is the way

This is Star Wars, utterly fantastic
grahamstephencross28 December 2019
I think the is the first review I have ever written on IMDB. What a surprise, the Mandalorian has me believing in the Star Wars universe again. The story, pacing, scenery and direction are all fantastic and recreates the Star Wars "feeling" and enjoyment I had when I watched the original trilogy. They have created something that's been missing from the last 6 Star Wars films, proving you don't have to try so hard, with forced humour and over the top plot lines. Just take a good story, pace it right and let the Star Wars story do the rest. Utterly fantastic, I have spoken.

the mandalorian is STAR WARS - accept THAT.
jamesjonathan28 December 2019
By the time the trailer for the mandalorian came out, i was very intrigued and hyped, especially when i heard jon favreau is showrunning. when the first episode premiered, i thought it was a bit underwhelming yet a very solid start to the series (and of course, who wasn't surprised to see THE CHILD? this is a really great move from disney, since they didn't include him in their marketing strategies until the episode was released). the next two episodes unraveled, and they both turned out to be GREAT. the fourth and fifth episode felt like unnecessary filler episodes, but i still quite enjoyed it. but the REAL peak was at the final 3 episodes, packed with well-done action scenes and some surprising moments. overall, was satisfied with the mandalorian season one. it managed to tell a somehow interesting and coherent story, with top-notch cinematography and some spaghetti western vibes. this is the best thing to come out of star wars for a while, and i hope jon favreau does more star wars-related projects. this is the WAY.

Not a show for all
kar35128 December 2019
First a disclaimer: I am a huge Star Wars fan, so some may find this a bias review.

Now that is out of the way...

To be perfectly honest, the Star Wars franchise was never famous by it's writing or acting performances. That can be seen since the first 3 movies (yes, 4,5 and 6) and it got worse in 1,2 and 3. While no movie or show can appeal to all, fans or not, there is no doubt, good or bad, the Star Wars franchise became a cult.

What is different in the Mandalorian? The acting? The storytelling? No. The acting is average at best, even with Pedro Pascal, he is not a bad actor but he is not the best. Is he suited for the job? Well, maybe, any average actor that does not show his face and have his voice modified can perform good.

The storytelling is by far intriguing, even with some additions that might change what did happened in the latest movies.

This is a pure western, in Star Wars, and to be honest, Star Wars was always a kinda of Western, fantasy storytelling. Kill the bad guys, save the princess (pun intended).

The thing that most 1 star reviews or bad reviews this show has, is that, the people that made those reviews cannot understand the core of Star Wars and the richness of the endless characters that Lucas gave us and the comic cannon develop.

The show is on par with the animated series "The Clone Wars" but better since it is not focused on light sabers fights and good and evil (maybe that is the first reason some people might get a bit critic about it).

The Mandalorians were always a interesting characters in the Star Wars Franchise, the Clone Wars animated series developed that a bit, and Star Wars Rebels animated series also focused on the Mandalorian world too.

The show has a great visual quality worthy of the movies in terms of special effects, sound, everything for us to think we are actually seeing a Star Wars movie. The only problem is the episodes are too short. Maybe to "copy" a bit what was done with "The Clone Wars" & "Rebels" episodes around 20 to 25 minutes.

Only the true fans that get into the characters richness that is Star Wars will get this show, it might not be for all, but it is Star Wars, it feels Star Wars and looks like Star Wars.

I will not give a 10/10 because of the short time span of the episodes and the average acting (which is not bad but is not amazing, but it fits the narrative).

It is a welcome addition after the poor performance of the last 3 movies (yes I am looking at you JJ) and a good quality in terms of visual aspects like we had in "Rogue One". It is a darker world, with some sort of comic lines in a sarcastic way, action that almost can fool me that I am not watching a Star Wars movie.

A fun and entertaining ride
bournejackal27 December 2019
The Mandalorian from the brain child of George Lucas and Jon Favreau . Is a story of a bounty hunter and his quest, until he finds something special. This is a tremendous series. The Mandalorian is a fun ride to watch. Loved everything about it. The characters are the best. Especially Baby Yoda & Greef. They are my favorites. Love seeing the stormtroopers back. The storylines are wonderful. My favorite episodes are. Chapter 2, Chapter 4, & Chapter 7. If you are a mediocre Star Wars fan. You need to watch it. If you're not. What's wrong with you. I had my doubts at first, but @jonfavreau you are a genius. Thank you. Who's ready for season 2? My rating is 9/10. #themandalorian #babyyoda #bountyhunter #starwars #disneyplus #georgelucas #jonfavreau

Star Wars redeemed!!!!
paulrose-2805527 December 2019
No spoilers! As a kid I grew up on in Star Wars, but nothing has captured the Magic of the original trilogy. The prequels were a CGI mess and never captured the magic. The most recent 3 had potential, but with all of today's politics, Disney decided to try and appeal to everyone except the original fan base. I'm all about being PC, but I felt as if every scene was shoving PC down my throat with no thought into the actual story. Rogue One was a step in the right direction, but everything else is trash. Mandalorian however pulled me back into what I loved most about Star Wars, a gritty story with heart, not overly done with CGI, but just told a good story without forcing PC down my throat. I'll take this show over all the prequels, and the last three movies any day of the week. I applaud the director and Disney for letting this show flow the way it should for a change. This actually felt like it was part of the original Star Wars universe which was outstanding to me. The episodes were short, but each was full and complete without feeling cheated. I hope this show stays the course and continues in the same direction for seasons to come. While I may not be going to see the movies anymore, I will remain a Disney+ subscriber for as long as this series continues to impress me. Please Disney, don't change a thing and Let Jon Favreau continue to develop and direct The Mandalorian!

Near-flawless spaghetti western...in space.
amzn-1250027 December 2019
After several years of flops from Disney Star Wars I was ready to hate this show for being another corporate failure. However, The Mandalorian has blown me away and is now my favourite show of all time.

It has great heart, humour, action, suspense, set pieces, and of course an all-star cast. Pedro Pascal was born to play this role, and supporting actors Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposit, Bill Burr, and Werner Herzog help to make the Mando's world a believable one.

This show has a whopping 120million dollar budget, which shows in the movie-quality of each episode. My only gripe? One episode could be removed from the season and it wouldn't affect the show in any way. I assume it was just used to introduce characters for the next season.

To summarise: a great show with a wonderful cast and soundtrack which shouldn't be missed by anyone.

Well Made
TheOtherVignesh27 December 2019
It's Good and well made one, Best part is it's not like other TV shows which has 60mins per episode and in which random things happen until in end where they leave some interesting thing at the end to make the binge watchers click the next episode, this one just 30mins long and just deals Story in simple way.

The visuals effects are nice, the cinematography is nice with wide aspect ratio and lot of camera movement unlike others shows, stunts are nice, overall It's cinematic and feels like you're watching a movie.

Maybe it's not greatest but it's well made commerical one that you can enjoy if you're star wars fan.

No droids - I like the way it's going
netseven-032847 December 2019
Thankfully, this is not another try on soap operas! No bunch of overlapping, long-running storylines woven around plot holes. No prequel of anything produced in the past! This is an episodic sci-fi western series without denying its roots. Star Wars fans may have some piece of background here but it really doesn't matter! There is decent action, comedy and drama, putting a charismatic protagonist in focus. And there is Baby Yoda as cute as can be. You can watch 1 episode, reset and forget about it. Next week, there may be another compact story to enjoy. Newcomers to this franchise can easily catch up and identify with a brandnew cast! Kudos to everyone who got involved in this production. Keep it up!

Compelling? Yes. Clunky? Yes.
bschimizze30 November 2019
Would this be considered a good show without the Star Wars back drop?

No.

I mean I will watch every episode. Baby Yoda and the mystery behind the Mandalorians are both extremely compelling.

But outside that, it's clunky. Pedro is doing a great job, but it's silly that he has such a badass reputation despite kinda sucking. He's not that great of a fighter. And I'm thinking "ok maybe he's super sneaky and strategic." But somebody sneaks up on him in EVERY EPISODE. That includes some giant-ass animal in the first episode. His "thing" is just that he has better tech than everyone else?

I guess Boba Fett himself went out like a punk, so it's at least consistent despite being disappointing.

The music is bad and doesn't fit much of the action. The main themes sound like knock-off Star Wars music.

The individual arcs for each episode are good. Every episode is an "adventure of the week", but I can get behind the space western vibe.

Still, the dialogue feels really casual. I'm not some film expert - is this due to writing, acting, or directing? I don't know how to describe it, but the tone feels off.

I'm trying really hard to understand why it seems so unpolished or rushed to me. Someone please help me out.

I'm enjoying the show actually. It just doesn't deserve gushing praise.

Finally a series that gives you the same nostalgia as the original trilogy...
RhyZe-UK23 November 2019
The creative team behind Star Wars has definitely worked exceptionally hard on this addition to the franchise.

It feels so fresh, but taps into many of the old features and ideas of the first trilogy to deliver something compelling and unique. I love the use of the live creature puppets, when done right it makes such a difference to the overall aesthetic and makes the environment CGI look even better.

Storywise, this is one of the best written plotlines in the Star Wars history for me. I won't give anything away as the reveal is one of the best parts of this show. The power is in the twist at the end of the first episode, giving you so much incentive and desire to watch the next. Rarely do I ever find a Pilot of a new series that gives me this kind of appeal!

Everything is also totally on form here too:
Movie Budget CGI & Costumes
Great Actors & Dialogue
Beautiful Locations
No Cringeworthy Humour
Edgy & Cool Ideas


And Most Importantly it has HEART.

Hands down the best new show of 2019...

Thank you Jon Favreau, writers, artists, crew THANK YOU!!!!!!!
jrberlet23 November 2019
I had given up on the new trilogy and had written off the Disney era of Star Wars. This show made me feel like I was a kid watching Star Wars again. I'm on episode 3 and it's the best thing to happen to Star Wars since the original trilogy. If you liked Rogue One you will like this series. I love the exploration of the gritty world of bounty hunters, smugglers, and Hutts. The episodes are short but true to the movie serial roots of Flash Gordon. At the end of each episode, you have to watch the next one. The writers respect the established lore and even use a few computer game conventions in the plot. Any user rating less than a 7 you can ignore. They are just mad we have our Star Wars back. This should be a 9.9!

The best part? No painfully transparent and cringe worthy topical nonsense from ideologues that have an exaggerated sense of self importance who think they are relevant enough for us to care about their political opinion. No Luke as the disgruntled boomer drinking green milk. No Vegan Chewbacca. No Leia Poppins. No emo Vader's grandkid. No evil villain without a backstory. No incompetent leadership that can break the Universe's physics and lore to destroy a ship with hyperdrive and gravity bombs...

a disgrace to StarWars
salcocco5 January 2020
How low and slow can we go? The story doesn't make any sence. Why does the Mandalorian do what he does? It doesn't have any logic at all! His behavior is totaly unpredictable. The story is told in a annoying slow pace. Nothing like StarWars should be. It also doesn't have the look and feel of Star Wars. Ik looks like a very cheap production. The music is bad and sounds like they only used one trumpet, one trombone and one violist. It's always dark, so you can't see how poor the decor and surroundings are. No detail at all, just old walls. There are also never more then five people at a time on screen. That doesn't make a crowd! Yes, it's very disappointing in all en everything. People who say otherwise probably never really liked the original Star Wars movies. What a waste. Sorry.

Wow this from the guy that made iron man!! Was looking forward to the first real gritty Star Wars as the trailers were cut to make it look. Instead we were laughing at the clunky writing and cheesy jokes that didn't work. It was so cool to see Jawas then they were used as the worst comedic fodder. Terrible. He's supposed to be the most bounty hunter in the galaxy and he was bested by everything. The only thing that felt like the original trilogy was the wipes. Woof

The Force is Strong with The Mandalorian
dylannash6512 November 2019
If you're a gunslinging, rowdy cowboy movie lover with a twist of Star Wars thrown into the mix, then The Mandalorian is your cup of tea. Great characters, fantastic acting, and a fleshed our world make for a great series SO FAR. The pacing is a bit slow, but with such great direction and set pieces, it's easy to forgive. I look forward to watching this series in its entirety and seeing just how strong the force is with The Mandalorian.

There's no substance to the story. Seems boring so far. The ratings will change soon I imagine.

Really?
mismak16 November 2019
I'd rather watch a western TV series from 50-60's. Cliché, easy to predict, terrible CGI, superficial and too fast paced.... I guess Disney did a Mandalorian movie, then it resulted a boring 3 hours thing.... Then, after the Solo failure, Disney board decides to release it as TV series....on their own platform. I'm very disappointed....... I don't know from where other people are getting the Star Wars vibe from this "thing". The Force is being destroyed.

Disappointing for adults, probably ok for kids
scifiactionfan2 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
The first episode was slow. The next few were good. The last few were bad. The last episode was especially bad. Maybe someone from Disney said to write more for kids. A lot of the dialog was very repetitive. It didn't make sense when the ig11 kept saying it had to protect the child but was willing to give it to a stranger (Cara). I thought the last episode got VERY childish.

The first 2 episodes are good.
MooWoolf129 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
So the first 2 episodes were good. What the series should have been about. Then it changes into a very bad direction.

Let's talk about Yoda. He was a very old creature. He was very wise and powerful.

Yoda always meant to be so wise and powerful because he was almost a thousand years old.

Well, this series said no. Yoda's age was no special. His real age should be about 90 years at his death. (In human years.)

Yoda was also not so strong because of his age and knowledge. No! He was born that way. Literally. He had to learn nothing. His kind is born with it. Just like the people in the new movies. They don't have to learn. They just know how to use the force. No matter what.

This is sucks because in the previous 6 films, you had to learn. In the new movies, you don't have to learn. (Can you see the difference? That's how the World changed in the last 15 years. Back then you had to work for it. Today, nobody wants to work for it. They're givin. Especially the kids.)

So the first 2 episodes were good, I liked them. But after the most hyped head hunter in the universe who was so good at everything made childish mistakes.. I knew it's going to be bad.

FYI, I do not consider anything else to be about Star Wars beside the first 6 movies and the books from that time.

The problem is that Lucas made 6 movies. For example, let's say in all of them the ground rule was that it is not possible to jump higher than 1 meter. In those movies only the most powerful ones were able to get close to that limit. And it took decades to achieve if you had it.

In the new series, movies and games and things every totally random person can jump higher no matter what.

Not bad, not great
ericbable19 November 2019
This show is over rated and it's only because it's Star Wars. Rip that title away, and you have a mediocre show that's slowly building interest with a lot of lazy writing. Quite cheesy at some moments.

It's decent, but no way is it a 9.

Feeling Like Classic Star Wars
vampirelusts15 November 2019
Original, and properly set for the pre-empire period. Interesting new characters, and technology of that early age that makes everything feel right. If back stories turn on the nerd in you, this new chapter is right on point and VERY promising.

I liked it, and I know I did because I didn't want to like it
Penske_Material13 November 2019
You might wonder why I didn't want to like it, and well, the answer to that is because I passionately hate the sequel trilogy, I enjoyed Rogue One, never saw Solo and I doubt I'll waste my time with episode 9.

However, this show seems to be a step in the right direction. I loved the cinematography, the "lived-in" feeling Lucas created, the music, the "spaghetti western" tone. I liked it a lot. It's too early to tell if the writing is good, but I liked how we were introduced into the story.

So far so good, let's see where the story goes with the next episode. I'm still concerned that the people in charge of Lucasfilm will find a way to ruin this, but at least I trust both Filoni and Favreau.

The biggest crime Disney has ever committed is not putting Dave Filoni in charge of Lucasfilms and get rid of a few people, who are not worthy of me mentioning their names, but they might as well admit they don't understand Star Wars because it's obvious they don't.

Well, after episode 1, not great, not terrible
Callinicus12 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Western? Check. Standard issue mexican border village is from a Fistful of Dollars.

Why they had to ride the Warhammer Fantasy squig? We never know, Old guy was just in funny mood. Ship could had aproach that location on low altitude undetected easily. Also bounty hunter was said be best in a parsec (which with Star Wars hyperspace basicly means "in this street" as a parsec is about 3 lightyears and Star Wars ships are about a 1000 times faster than Star Trek vessels) in a mood he is a professional. Yet he lacks a speeder bike on his not too small ship. Also he was so professional, he didn't hear a rusty door opening right behind him, or two rhino sized meatball aproaching him. Couldn't that helmet have a zoom function, or any at all? It so just a shiny hat, without reason. Not taking off (what if he sneeze? or hungry? or want to give his girlfriend a good lick time?) is really overacted fansrvice. At the point of the girldalorian I felt it was written by a 10 year old, ALSO her helmet were so greek it lost the mandalorian starwars design feeling.

Mentioning "fuel" is a PTSD cause in me.

The Warhammer 40000 eldar guardian scatterlaser anti-grav platform were a good stuff, I liked it. Hope he keeps it, might be useful later. As the village is most likely massacred entirely, he could look for a speeder they had, he might need that too.

A 1000 of those droid could conquer planets, just saying. It was sturdy, precise, and obidient to its programming. Don't know why First Order or Empire did not use those. I guessed the droid will be a main character, so I was a bit suprised when it died, but it was coming.

How .bounty hunting guild works? Who they are working for? If any bounty anyone gives off, they should be hunted down as criminals, because in most time, they would doing criminal jobs.

Yoda said in Return of the Jedi he is over 900 years old, and in Empire Strikes Back, he trains jedi for 800 years. Therefor I guess he is a jedi for about the age of 100 AT LEAST. If the species is a toddler at the age of 50, do they have an extremely fast puberty period, or are they evolving into higher stages pokemon style? If baby will start to speak and spread divine wisdom next time I will cry...

Honestly not too great, nothing special, feels like a fanfic, or roleplaying adventure modul scenario. But it is a decently written one, I liked the mood, sometimes comicly slowing time when nothing special or epic happens, and the backstory fleshbacks were very Rogue One. Solo had a lot of fanservice, but this show essentially is nothing but fanservice. If that were the intention, does the job.

Reminds me of Poochie the dog.
jonathanmarklund15 November 2019
Remember that old Simpsons episode where the executives thought that they needed a new character in 'itchy and scratchy' so they created poochie the dog. A dog that could do everything. Rap, play basketball, skateboard and just be "super cool".

Yeah, that is what this feels like. The main characters is so OP (over-powered) that there is absolutely no tension or drama to the show.

They have basically tried to cram as much star wars nostalgia into the show that nobody questions what is going on or why. It's like a microwave dinner: Something artificial produced for people that don't know better and don't care if it's good or not.

Probably the worst written thing since someone decided to add 'the right to bear arms' to the American Constitution
nigepitz24 January 2020
Oh, where to start. Everyone told me this was amazing and after the first episode I was almost tempted to agree. But boy, did things go downhill fast after that. The last episode (8) maybe the worst written and acted thing, in any medium, I have ever seen. Nonsensical plot, indestructible heroes, never in jeopardy, even when outnumbered 100-1 and some of the most wooden dialogue ever performed. My disappointment is almost matched by my anger that this bag of turds is the best that Disney can do with an asset they paid more than $4 billion for. If you have rated this higher than 5/10 you are a moron

The future of Star Wars
thomaswilson2027 December 2019
Was pleasantly surprised at how good this series is. Everything Star Wars has tried and failed to do in the past. Love the slow paced storyline, interesting characters, edgy music, beautiful landscapes and subtle humour (droid kicking the animal out of the way while learning to drop a box, or Carl Weather and Yoda's 'do the hand thing' moment). Episodes 7 and 8, in my opinion, features better content than any of the new prequels and sequels. Maybe Rogue One comes close. Very excited for the future of Star Wars if this is how it unfolds. Well done to Waititi and Favreau for breathing new life into the franchise. I hope others agree!

I Am A real Reviewer
catschasemice959427 December 2019
I was at the first day of the very showing of the first Star Wars movie. It was uncomplicated fun that entertained in an era that needed it. The Mandolorian brings back that joy. Martin Scorsese won't like it since it isn't cinema. If you hate this series don't watch it. However, there are actual people who do. We aren't Disney employees. Our taste isn't the same as yours. Valid criticism is fine and healthy. There are other great choices in the big universe of shows. Good luck.

Entertaining and nostalgic, but suffers heavily from pacing issues and a story that doesn't seem to be going anywhere
Oliveraandreasson21 December 2019
Overall, the show is enjoyable and captures the feeling and atmosphere of the original trilogy perfectly. The set and character designs, score and cinematography are all beautiful and makes for a fun 35-ish minutes that compromises each episode. What does keep me from giving the series a higher rating is the, to me, very weird pacing, that I believe is a byproduct of the short episodes and large amount of characters and environments the showrunners want to cram in. Episodes 3-6 also suffered from not really moving the main story forward in any significant way, leaving you longing for something interesting to happen and for answers to your burning questions.

Deep Star Wars Essence
lloskka21 December 2019
Mr Dave Filoni, and Mr Jon Favreau

Oh man, these two dont know yet, what they acomplished.

If you want experience ( even for the first time ) the Star Wars universe, this is where is your STOP.

Somehow, you feel identified with each of the characters, and that is something that few movies get

The wonderful world presented leads you to imagine that you are one of the family

Theres so much it can be done in the future with the expanded lore, from the known universe, til across the entire unkown regions.

KEEP IT GOIN!

Brings the galaxy together
peterallertonwriter21 December 2019
This has saved SW for me after the disappointment of the new trilogy - and has also helped redeem Disney. It's like Clint Eastwood in Mos Eisley, drawing on features from all parts of the SW galaxy (ie the other trilogies, tv shows and even books). Too bad they didn't give the new trilogy to the Mando team.

Really impressed at this point
thedominator-7475715 December 2019
Everything about this series is amazing and in my opinion a whole lot better than any new star wars films I have unfortnutely seen. Jon Favreau did a great job on this. The acting has been fantastic so far, the visuals of course are great but it actually surprised me as I was not expecting that much but I was honestly amazed. The episodes have been really great so far, I have been trying to space out my watching so I dont binge it all. I love seeing so much that really takes me back. I wish this series the best and I hope Disney realise this is the quality they need to start using.

I Haven't Met One Person Who Doesn't Like This Show
joey-1287314 December 2019
The Mandalorian is a great show and it leaves you on the edge of your seat. You do not have to be a die-hard Star Wars fan to watch this show. The episodes come out in chronological order. One episode is released every Friday. It is a great show to watch as a family, and I really do think this show is well-made. It gets fans hyped up for Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker. I love what they have done with this show. The reason I didn't give it a 10 star review is because it is Disney Plus exclusive. Therefore, if you have not subscribed to Disney Plus, you can not watch this show. But, I do think it is worth due to the amazing variety. Overall, The Mandalorian is a fantastic show, and it is definitely worth buying.

I'll be in my bunk
Patrick_Unrast14 December 2019
Just to clear the air up front: The show being episodic television isn't the problem. Some of my favourite shows of all time are episodic. And one of them, Firefly, seems to come up a lot when discussing The Mandalorian. Seems logical, since both are episodic Space Westerns. What I don't get, is how people bring up Firefly to defend The Mandalorian, when it so clearly showcases the major problems the latter has. Firefly has an ensemble of interesting, multi-faceted characters and self-contained episodes that don't feel like first drafts or basic story archetypes.

Just compare the mandatory "Magnificient Seven" episodes in both shows. "Heart of Gold" is probably my least favourite Firefly episode and still, at least it has interpersonal conflict between main-characters we actually care about and brings personality to its one-off characters. Without the Star Wars IP, The Mandalorian's version would have absolutely nothing intriguing in it. No interesting characters, dialogue or plot. Each episode plays out like the most basic version of that particular story. It looks great, feels right at home in the universe and has things we recognize from the movies, but is so incredibly shallow and boring in terms of its writing that I can't be bothered to care about much happening on the screen.

It started off quite strong, but developed into being mediocre. It might pick up its pace and get better over time, but please stop comparing it to Firefly, because they sure made the best out of the one season they had.

This is definitely what the Star Wars universe needs! SO happy that there is no "political agenda" being shoved in our faces (in the first few episodes at least, although why Kathleen Kennedy is still listed as a Producer and hasn't been fired is beyond me!).

Jon Favreau, we the fans thank you for bringing us something to actually care about once again, I definitely won't be going to waste my money on SW9. Will continue watching in anticipation to see where this show goes - don't mess it up!

dsemasin30 November 2019
This show is serious, with appropriate star wars humor. No "your momma" jokes! Great movie like production values. This might be able to salvage part of the damage that Rian Johnson did to the franchise. Nothing can truly make up for TLJ, but this is a great start in the right direction.

I'm a 14 year old girl, and I LOVE the Mandalorian
elizabethmyles27 November 2019
I don't like Star Wars, I was too young to understand and enjoy the older movies, and the Last Jedi was awful. I didn't think I'd enjoy this show. I didn't even know what a Yoda was. But toss me high and eat my pie. This show is INCREDIBLE! I never thought I a show about a man who's face is never seen could possibly be so captivating. The exquisite meaning of Following the Code, and having a purpose beyond simple money and fame. The Mandalorian has no right or wrong, he does what he thinks is right. We should all live this way. The Empire is what we live in, We need a New Republic. I'm sick of my Australian overlords. They kill koalas. I hate the Liberals. Please, don't vote for them. Think of my future. :(

10/10, I recommend all 14 year old and above watch this and show their parents.

You are totally captivated from the very first episode, it is truely a work of art in story telling. You do not have to be a Star Wars fan to appreciate this series, whether you are an adult or teenager, it will appeal to all audiences. The music, the dialogue, the high quality of filming, and FX, comes together a true NEW master piece. No modern day awkwardness, no cheesy lines, and all the characters are excellent actors. Jon Favreau thank you for creating this new world! 10 Plus Stars for this series, you wil not be disappointed, so watch it!

Finally. Aside from one major issue.
wcparry222 November 2019
Like Rogue One this put me back to Star Wars roots, and feels.

Except for the music. It lacks the nuances of early Star Wars movies and as much as I hate to say it the prequels. Star Wars has lived and thrived on orchestral music driving the movie End theme of the movie Forward. For some reason the underlying music except at the very end of Mandalorian episode 2 (it sounded and felt RIGHT) had more of a Danny Elfman had a baby with a cartoon feel, instead of the London Symphony or orchestra beating your eardrums with epic wonder. The sounds and music lack the subtleties and originalities that made Star Wars what it is. You know things like using a bad freezer motor for a droid's movement or something awesome and ridiculous like that.

But the fact is, the plot structure, the acting, the visual subtleties and beauty, the darkness, grit and the writing have brought Star Wars back to life. Just have Jon Favreau do all of anything else Star Wars. Just do better with the orchestra

ITS STAR WARS AT ITS CORE! BUT BETTER! But omg guys make the episodes longer please. I just want more and more they have an amazing start and could have something super special here I hope they treat it right.

Not bad, but lower your expectations
alexzhivkov18 November 2019
Oh, I thought this was gonna be different, alas... The same hero/lame stuff. The good guys always strike on, the bad guys always miss. The same big weapon that couldn't go through a column, destroyed a very stable(supposedly) gate. And those piggy creatures that the mandalorian tried to ride, they fell down after a second from the sleeping dart(or whatever that was). And how did the mandalorian get on that tank, after falling down just a couple of seconds earlier?!? The acting is okay, the story is interesting(at least for the "Star wars" fans like me), but that typical American unnecessary heroism is ruining it for me.

Episodes are painfully short
krisdoucet15 November 2019
I'm sorry but I'm extremely dissatisfied with the runtimes for each episode. 33 minutes? Seriously? Yes the 2 episodes that have been released to the public have been enjoyable but I'm only giving 8 because I really believe this kind of content should have a 45 min runtime at minimum for each episode. If this is the plan for every Disney+ series I'm not sure if I'm ever going to renew my subscription. I'll stick to my VPN...

mhjholland14 November 2019
Watched it through twice now and agree with all the positive reviews. Love the look and feel of this episode and so excited to see more. Lots of people saying there's no plot and they wanted to know more of the backstory to the Mando but that would have just dragged the first episode down. I'm sure that will all come in future episodes and there were glimpses of where he came from. For the first episode I wanted Star Wars and action and that's def what this episode provides! Nice nods to the original films as well, which is always nice!

drumskostas13 November 2019
Disney nailed this one! I started watching the first episode with my expectations set to 0 due to the past Star Wars atrocities but to my surprise I got hooked!

I never though the story of the mandalorian could be interesting to begin with but I loved the way they filmed and directed it! They shaped it into an amazing classic star wars adventure, without any feminist references and propaganda which completely ruined the last 2 movies!

I truly wish the rest of the episodes are as great as the first one!

Keep it up!

it had a tad of comedy
puppypet13 November 2019
The show is a darkly I mean hunting people down there will be violence but I also saw it had a little comedy from the Star Wars theme. I can only hope that the show does not sink into just violence but the comedy was the best part.

I'm not a fan of this aspect ratio losing 20% or more of my TV but they seem to think cutting the top and bottom off makes it look better which by the way it just cuts off that's what it looks like.

I don't think you can expect this to be a happy show so take that with a grain of salt. I'm hoping the show picard can have a type of inspiration that Star Trek was famous for. But I'm not sure you'll find any in the show

anyway it wasn't that bad I was surprised

The start of a new era, the episode was flawless, such a great start of the new Star Wars serie, great acting, amazing music, it didn't feel like the new Star Wars movies, The Mandalorian gave me a Rouge One vibe, which is amazing, the mandalorian took me back to the old and good part of Star Wars. This is going to be such a huge success for all the old Star Wars fans. I like how the gave The Mandalorian such a dark and secret vibe, which gives the character a more interesting look. It feels like this is going to be a banger, one of the main reasons people are going to get Disney plus. This actually gives me hope for the rest of the Star Wars franchise.

Didn't work for me
tranat7114 November 2019
Yeah, this 1st episode didn't work for me.

It feels like a Star Wars episode. By that, I mean it lacks character development and plot, the 2 salient ingredients in any great story. LOL.

All I see are bad jokes, a bunch of shooting, stupid looking aliens and robots, and everything I couldn't care less about.

I guess if you like the SW Ep 1-3, Ep 7-8 and Solo, you might also like this crappy TV series.

But if you like good character development and plot, man, you are going to absolutely hate this TV show. LOL.

Fairly boring
dreduardo-5358115 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Had hope for it, but it turned out to be pretty boring. It is a little hard to define why but several elements stand out. First, the main character has no emotional expression what so ever. Partly thanks to always having an helmet on, (for reasons that are vague) but also doesn't express any emotion or feeling at all. Just an efficient soldier. The plot is tissue thin and rips easily. It is a sort of distillation of a lot of mediocre westerns. It depends on one action sequence after another but with no plot or character, you don't feel invested in any way. Like watching a football game between two teams you don't care about where all the plays are predicable. It seems to me that this is another nail in the coffin of Star Wars. There is a tiny twist at the end, but I don't expect that will turn out to be very much. They managed to neither capture the original or to add any thing new.

Rough Start
wadefan-897-34242013 November 2019
Weak start for The Mandalorian. It feels rather low-budget and the performances are nothing to write home about. The visuals can't compare to other Star Wars productions either. I found the writing and dialogue to be lacking as well. Overall, first episode is just above average.

Slap stick for 13 year olds : )
jesustoast-7175127 November 2019
Its better than "Days of our lives" but is far from the misleading shorts advertised leading up.. Could of been amazing but more of a romp for 8 to 13 year olds and those still living in mums basement. Though with all that said, its still better than 90% of what passes for entertainment. Happy viewing : )

Flurting without passion
kallerklintarn18 November 2019
I find pieces of the first episode good. But often I got distracted from the story and the environment by the horrible music constantly playing in the background. Take that out, and the viewer will be able to focus on the story. Hopefully the series will improve cause there is potential to tell a different story in the Star wars universe that doesn´t involve lightsabers and pesky jedies/sith that rarely does anything except being smug.

d_ohanlon8217 November 2019
Cinematography and directing are spot on, but this suffers from a slow plot with very short episodes. Slow is fine, but the episodes need more content. The writing and story is very simplistic and there's no depth. Yes I'll finish the season and continue to enjoy it, but I won't be back for more. "I have spoken"

They should have used the money to restore the original Star Wars trilogy
MovieCriticOnline28 December 2019
This is so cringeworthy to watch and even more to see that some people think this is the best thing they've seen. It gets gradually worse by the week, and it started bad so now it has just become a joke and I have to force myself to watch it.

They are treating it like a joke and a bad joke that is. The latest episode with the scout troopers was so horrendous to listen to.

Disney needs to immediately stop destroying the legacy of Star Wars before it's totally ruined.

I HATE THIS SHOW!!

Cool Visuals but the Storyline is Meh...
hill-2019 November 2019
As most of you, I was excited to see this new installment of the Star Wars universe. But as most of you, I'm starting to become super disappointed in the story writing as such the same as SW episode 7 & 8.

There have been so many plot holes. This TV show is writing with 4-11 year olds in mind. Anyone older than that will start to ask questions on why the writers and director decided to take such blatant shortcuts when producing this lackluster story.

Disney is on it's way to making another "safe" Star Wars story that does nothing to push the envelope of the SW universe. It relies on familiar characters from past movies and when the viewer is introduced to someone or something new, the back story is never detailed and quickly you don't care.

I can't help but blame Disney for ruining another childhood SW character like they did for my beloved Han Solo and Chewbacca.

If you absolutely love Star Wars, you'll probably overlook the huge plot holes and lack of creative writing, just as my 6 year old did.

Beyond terrible
chatorech27 December 2019
Clearly 99% of the reviews here are fake or they are done by people who have not even watched this piece of garbage. No story, awful actors and horrendous special effects. This series looks like extremely B... where did all the super budget go to? Disney should be ashamed to push this as their title series! I am a huge fan of Star Wars, yet Stranger Things or Game of Thrones are a gazillion times better than this crap....

This is the fourth time I've started over trying to write my review. Every time I get a paragraph in the page refreshes and I have to start over. This show is not worth the work it takes to write a review. It is a 6 out of 10 and that's saying a lot because it's the best thing created since the original trilogy and it's still not even that good.

Jon Favreau...MY MAN!
mjlower-2899124 December 2019
First of all... Thank you Mr. Favreau! In my opinion "all Marvel movie directors should film at least one Star Wars movie... So we don't have a repeat of Rian Johnson's piece of crap that ruined a franchise..." (I mean who throws away the previous directors notes when doing a sequel to such a beloved franchise? What The H?) Anyway, my opinion is this: watch it, it is everything you are missing from the movies. Thank you. 11/10

This is SW for fans
edlc197010 December 2019
The Mandalorian has all the ingrediens of the SW universe. Its a pleasure to watch for a huge SW fan like me. I would say its even better than for instance The Force awakens. Finally Disney restores Star Wars. And for all the haters that says it lacks a story. Either you dont know what you are watching or you have no grib on the series. The story is about a lone bounty hunter, which has gone "roque" when he brakes the bounty hunters code, and saves the child. It is not a full lenght movie you are watching, but a TV series. And if you dont like, then stop watching and leave the pleasure to the rest of us, who knows what quality is. I just hope Disney makes a lot more episodes and seasons. Oh and i got to get me a baby Yoda doll.

Only a few episodes in, but I already have to say, well done. Jon Favreau, well done. Hoping there's more like this in the future.

The Mandelorian is an instant win--a show that respects Star Wars in its original form. The story and characters are new but comfortably familiar. Well written, nice pacing, keeps you wanting more across episodes, all with movie-quality production.

Poorly made!
smmrshaon28 December 2019
I understand the cult following of the star wars universe and why the rating is so high. But if it were something else, this would have been rated very low by a lot of people. While the concept is great by Jon Favreau, the directors did a really bad job. A lot of scenes aren't logical at all or unnecessary or doesn't fit with the character. This remains one of the high profile show I watched which is borderline garbage.

Special shoutout to Episode 6, felt like it was made by some amateur people. Garbage acting, rubbish direction.

The Adventures of Boba Meh
paulblawrence14 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Being an old school fan of Star Wars, and a Boba Fett devotee, yet overly disppointed with the recent films, I was not excited to see this. I'm glad I subverted my expectations. Mandalorian is clearly written for kids. I found way to many problems with the story, the acting and the script. For a Mandolorian merc, this protagonist talks way to much. His first, pretitle action sequence is too quick, and too underwhelming. Aliens in this apparent galaxy should know by now not to mess with Mandolorians. I'm sick of characters in Hollywood dying just for being stupid. That's not a challenge for our mercenary. Furthermore, this merc is not only too talkative, but he's got a heart of gold, and that really is a problem. Not only is he actually a nice guy, but worse, he's a terrible bounty hunter! His weapons are underwhelming, his ship looks boring, he gets attacked and defeated by giant muppets in broad daylight, and he is shown up by another bounty hunter, an IG-88 model who is a much better mercenary, combatant and strategist. Its a shame the droid dies, by our "hero". It would have been better if they teamed up. Hero's teaming up with droids has been nothing new and IG is awesome in this episode. The story is just boring. An entire side story, which goes on way too long, is our merc learning to ride the giant muppet. I was looking at my watch too often. The episode ends with the merc discovering that the bounty is nothing more than a CGI baby muppet. I won't say which but a dangerous villain would have been a much better climax. This show is already overrated. And since there's not one white, strong male character in the show, its clear where the shows headed. I saw episode one. No interest in watching episode two.

ibrahimtoeima-127164 January 2020
How any recent Star Wars story could be really into Star Wars these days. If so, and we ought to select, it will be this incredibly heartwarming and magnificent piece of art; The Mandalorian. The force here is real, the force here comes from the beating heart of our beloved theme of Star Wars, which's hope. There is no overpowered, Marvel-like, self-centered, money-making or politically corrected persona. Just the force, and no more. This is our and only Star Wars in this era of the forced and abused force. May the force be with you Mando.

n-826733 January 2020
This is the way! Just as "Grand Theft One" has proved that the universe of Star Wars series is huge, there is no need to tell the story of the Skywalker family. A good story of such a grand universe is always better than a strong act of continuing to write Skywalker and the Jedi. It is hoped that Star Wars can continue to explore the Star Wars universe starting from the Mandalorians.

Babyyoda234528 December 2019
Aside from the original trilogy, the other Star Wars movies have been attempting to recreate that same magic, unsuccessfully.

This show kind of recaptures that magic, if even just a little bit. It has renewed my interest in the franchise and can explore so much more than the movies ever could.

And this good review isn't just because baby Yoda is adorable (but it's a factor).

abasu081928 December 2019
"The Mandalorian" started off as a spin-off of Star Wars franchise, only to eventually go down as the greatest Star Wars movie or show ever alongside the Luke Skywalker Saga (including Rogue One)! Jaw-dropping action, fabulous story, exciting and memorable characters, crunchy dialogues, neat cinematography, magnificent CGI/VFX, perfect cast & what not. Simply flawless & much beyond a simple tag of "Masterclass", to say the least! Go, don't miss it at any cost!

Perks-22-27207127 December 2019
I've grown up with Star Wars from the beginning. How I feel watching the Mandalorian is how I wanted to feel watching the sequel trilogy. It's basically good storytelling brought back. Characters are given good endings and not written off in a footnote. Characters have good arcs. There are constant call outs to the Star Wars universe at large. The plot points, mysteries and characters are meaningful to the Star Wars universe without mucking up the characters we already know and love.

Thank you, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni!

If John Ford directed Star Wars
thomasbunink27 December 2019
This series feels like Star Wars. It's one man's journey to become part of something greater than itself. It tells a story in an existing universe while managing to be original, unpredictable and respectful to it's audience. Where the movies may suffer from "member berries", Filoni makes a swashbuckling adventure that adds to the canon in a way that has fans and casual viewers alike hooked.

Star Wars as it should be.
thomaselers-5204125 December 2019
This is so satisfying, so much better than the last 3 movies combined. It looks, sounds and most importantly FEELS like Star Wars. I love it.

I wish they'd make it into a proper feature movie as the episodes are too short. (SW is a universe you want be sucked into, "to live & breathe" for 2 hours forgetting everything around you, not small 30 minute digests which feels more like a ruined orgasm)

Mandalorian is somehow back to basics, without to much use of CGI unless necessary. It also doesn't need to rely to much on CGI, as it actually has a proper story and script, so no need to cover things up with pretentious CGI.

I know it sounds like a contradiction, Star Wars being Star Wars, but I consider The Mandalorian to be Star Wars for adults and long time fans.

rbeato2319 December 2019
Mandalorian is the best thing to come out from Disney since they bought the Star Wars franchise. Rogue One was also great as are the animated films but this show is on another level. It really rekindled my love for Star Wars lore. Disney needs to remove Kathleen Kennedy and put Filoni & Favreau in charge. Had they had a say in the new movies they'd have been much better.

great start, even greater disappointment
sethzhanberry17 December 2019
I am a huge Star Wars fan. I'm watching the Return of the Jedi as I write this review. The Star Wars fanbase is some of the most loyal fans in any kind of entertainment, sports included. I still fire up Battlefront on my ps2 every now and then. It is quite tragic how this series has been treated since the original trilogy. It never can seem to catch a break.

I Put all the recent hate aside. I was so excited for this show. The first episode was incredible, I really enjoyed how they incapsulated the audience with a good strong opening scene. The visual and sound design is the best it has ever been in any Star Wars movie or game. There are many cameos and easter eggs giving kudos to the original films. The armor of the Mandalorian is so cool, I love how they are going into that unexplored part of Star Wars. It being like a "western" is somewhat of a good idea. Finally, Baby Yoda is very cute, maybe the cutest thing I have ever seen.

However, after the first two episodes, the plot, acting, and writing of the show seem to hit a very slippery slope. First of all, the episode length is just too short. 30 minutes? Are you kidding me? The later episodes have made it extremely clear this can't work. Since it's supposed to be a "Western" Mando is supposed have various tasks on different planets and what not. Makes sense, he is a bounty hunter, but there just simply isn't enough time to properly make these episodes fulfilling in such a short amount of time. This is the foundation for the people complaining about the plot and how it literally goes nowhere. Simple algebra though. Mando goes to X, meets X, he needs to find X, baby yoda is in trouble because of X, destroys X and receives X prize.

Mando is constantly getting kicked. He never actually seems to be as cool or fierce as you would think. He always is getting saved by something or someone by a thread of a needle. He always is open to help and never seems to live up to the incredible Mandalorian name. He should work alone right? This guy is supposed to be once of the most dangerous warriors in the galaxy? Not at all.

The writing. Oh my. The amount of times I have cringed at the writing in the show is too much. Nothing can beat Anakins criticism of sand, but it is very close to being that bad sometimes. I can say the entirety of episode 4 is filled with this awful writing. Episode 4 gets a 1/10 for me. If you have seen Seven Samurai, you've already seen this episode. It was so hard for me to suspend my disbelief for all of it! Some people have tried so hard to defend it but it's just too much for me. It's awful. Honestly I couldn't wait for that episode to be over.

Next, is the character development. Which there is none of at all. We have learned little to nothing about Mando. It's almost like they avoid giving this guy a backstory by bringing in these random characters almost the way. They even had the nerve to put in a love scene in episode 4? The show introcudes these characters so rapidly and Mando just befriends them instantly. Like dude, aren't you a bounty hunter? What? Don't expect any development into any of these characters they add, can't afford that in 30 minute episodes! I would be so ok with them not giving much character development if they gave more context about the state of the galaxy since the empire has been terminated. I want to hear more about what has been going on now there is no "order." Give us more Star Wars context please.

Lastly, and I can't avoid this question. Where the would this show be without Baby Yoda? Seriously. Right when I saw it my heart melted. So cute. Very interesting way to introduce the show. It being such a high target and all. Now, a few episodes and a thousands memes later, the cuteness is beginning to seem like the only thing this show has going for it. There is literally no info on baby yoda or it's sigfnicance to the ones collecting the bounty or now Mando himself. He's just carrying it around now which can be tracked by every bounty hunter in the galaxy. The more I think about it even, the more the idea of baby Yoda actually ticks me off. Yoda was the master of all the Jedi, he was the key to everything in the original trilogy. Without Yoda, there would be no Star Wars. Yoda and the force represented many important ancient philosophies and understanding of life and nature that have long been forgotten in this material western world we live in. He is a symbol of how we all have a divine nature and luminescence within all of us. Yoda should have his own show for crying out loud! There is a great template for an offspring of Yoda. But all that's done with his legacy is a disneyfied cuteness magnet so millions of merchandise is sold this holiday. Just get on with it already, make him a bigger part of the story rather than just being a complete burden to Mando. Put off the cuteness shades and actually look what this baby yoda is doing to the show and Star Wars fans and it will make you scratch your head. Even the words Baby Yoda seem like an oxymoron to me.

Overall, i'm very disappointed in this show. Absolutely doesn't deserve a 9/10. These people rating this game a 9 or 10 is just dishonest. Where is the honesty? If there was no Star Wars name to this show it wouldn't last more than one season. If you are buying Disney+ just for this show, I'm sorry. Boba Fett has been put to shame with this goon wearing Mandalorian armor. Started strong, but then... plop!

Disney and star wars might actually work out
nickmorris211114 December 2019
Being a devoted star wars fan and not really taking to the last few movies disney has renewed my faith that they can take this serious and give us the fans what we really want if you're reading this to see if you should watch it go now and enjoy the magic that has been created in this wonderful show

First episode was refreshing... then mehh
ari-996-95386113 December 2019
So, I really enjoyed the first episode and found this a refreshing addition to the Star Wars family. Since then though, not much great happening. I've been super disappointed with the first two sequel trilogy movies and am not a fan of Kennedy's management of Star Wars, or at least the handling of the Skywalker saga. A travesty so far. Rogue One and Solo were terrific. Loved the OT, and liked ROTS/Attack of the Clones, but not Phantom Menace.The Mandalorian stories are just too bland. Sure, baby Yoda is really cute and the Mandalorian himself is ok, but Manda is just not a strong enough character, too soft for his britches. He should be cooler, compassionate is ok, but more bad ass, etc. The many references to the original trilogy, Jawas, sandpeople, various robots, etc. is a nice touch (not trying too hard), it's just not enough to make this a great series.

It's amazing how many people immediately dubbed Favreau as the solution to the Kennedy problem. Very premature in my opinion. That being said, like a die hard Star Wars fan, I'm still going to watch every episode and enjoy what I can from the Universe we all love.

Bring Ron Howard back to Star Wars. Let's see what Kevin Feige can do. Let's see some more adventurous writing, but nothing from Rian Johnson. He's a tool.

How many fake reviews can Disney buy?
wes-ricketts7 December 2019
"Jon Favreau nailed it!" Please... There's zero story arc, a bland main character, no supporting characters, and not enough tension for anyone to care about what's going on. Never have I seen a Star Wars show with such lifeless dialogue. I'm gifting this show 4 stars because I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but damn, get your crap together before this show flat out flops.

Entertaining enough with good action. However the writing could be improved. Just not providing much more than some entertaining action here and there. Could have been much more creative, and really something to add to you MAYBE list of shows to watch.

"Baby" saved the show
arloverich3 December 2019
While i was watching the 1st episode the show didnt looked nothing special to me. I though: "Well, bounty hunter goes on his missions for his bounty and probably the whole show will be about something like that..." So i though it will become boring very soon, untill the end of the first episode...

After the end of that episode i was happy that i was wrong and when i saw other episodes and direction in which the show started to go, with each episode i liked the show more and more. So while the show is going in that direction, there is great potential for it...

Also i like calmnes and seriousness of the characters and the plot. There are jokes to, but as much as it needs to be.

capnjmoroni24 November 2019
The Mandalorian is the best thing to happen to Star Wars since the original trilogy! It brings me back to my childhood of watching the original movies and being taken away to a new world! It has the feel of an old John Wayne or Clint Eastwood western with all the fun and wonder of Star Wars! I highly recommend this show to everyone, Star Wars fan or not!

marcelfernandezromero23 November 2019
I have to say, dont like the first trilogy, my favorite SW movie is the phantom menace. This show though... it's something else, unlike the JJ Abrams movie which simply takes from the aesthetics, this one is simply SW, new material with the same feels, 10 10. No complains. also baby Yoda is too cure for this cruel galaxy.

Good Star Wars, will be great when they add more new things
luisq0523 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The show it's great, and it's better than the, hopefully not canon in the future, sequel trilogy. I can only find a couple of things "bad" with the show, and it's that it relys too much on fan service nostalgia, Mandalorian bounty hunter and baby Yoda, and the baby itself, the aging of the creature and it's use of the force are exaggerated, but they are not big flaws.

I hope they start bringing more and more new content and leaving the fan service aside, I want to see new and exiting things, nostalgia is good and all, but please, there's a whole universe to explore.

"I have spoken!"
tadijai19 November 2019
So far 10/10, if you like original trilogy you will like this. It is a great start and i don't like that the episodes are 30 min, thats too short. I like that it happend things that you don't expected. It were so many easter eggs and I like that. We will see the rest of the season, but so far it's going in good way."I have spoken!" might be my favorite quote from this episodes and I'm sure there will be others. I'm sorry if my english is terrible, but I'm trying to learn. Have a nice day!

I watched with a bit of caution, because the last tree movies in my opinion isn't even Star Wars. But this, this is what I am talking about. You can finally feel the vibe and suspense of old star was. And the plot is unique too. Can't wait for next episode.

A Space Western to Watch
RayRaffaele19 November 2019
Truly enjoyed the first two episodes. I want more and look forward to what's coming. I value that Mandalorian maintains integrity to the original films without losing focus that it's a modern film. Well balanced between graphics, decoratives, makeup and custom.

Cinematography, Direction, Lighting and Sound are impeccable.

I honestly wasn't sure what to expect in regards to the narrative. I did expect a different voice from the Mandalorian. The origin story of one of the characters was an epic idea and entertaining.

Truly amazing work.

Credit scene art is superb.

lquinlan-1763619 November 2019
I am a HUGE fan of the original trilogy (I'm 43). The Mandalorian actually is very reminiscent of the original trilogy. This is very nostalgic with familiar characters, landscapes, technology, etc. I absolutely LOVE this series so far though I'm just 2 episodes in. Jon Favreau wrote this well and you can tell he's a total fanboy of the original movies. I encourage those who loved the originals to check this out.

Also, 2 words- baby Yoda.

This is the best star wars anything since return of the jedi and we are only 2 episodes in. This is the best show I've seen since the first season of true detective. This show is true to its title there is no side stories just all mandalorian! If you love stars this is a must watch. If you kinda like star wars or have never seen this is still a must watch!

Doesn't have that Star Wars feel
noahskates17 November 2019
From the first episode, I feel like nothing has really "happened" yet, if that makes any sense. It also doesn't really feel too much like Star Wars, and I Think I've figured out why. The Music. The soundtrack is good, but it sounds nothing like Star wars. Also the episodes are way too short, it doesn't give them enough time to develop a good enough plot in that amount of time.(just from the first episode)

brianjross147416 November 2019
You can tell this is made by people who understand and care about Star Wars. First two episodes have been very solid so far. Good pacing and effects for a TV show. One very small criticism - there's a reason actual trained actors should be used. Horatio Sans and Brian Pohsein stick out like sore thumbs in Ep 1. Horatio sounds like a normal dude in a NY diner. Not menacing, clever, evil, villainous or anything. It doesn't sell as a wanted man.

Season 1 finale - letdown
janjeltes15 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I've changed my mind. The Mandalorian is a letdown and an ominous sign. This series has some great moments but is constantly let down by persistent and blatant identity politics. It also has the obligatory ninja-warrior who takes down a dozen storm-troopers in a few seconds in moves that would put any REAL Star Wars character to shame. Best sharpshooter? Best fighter? All identity politics and totally unrealistic. The sharp-shooter surviving in the wild-west as a 3lb nothing? Hmmm. This series will please fans who don't worry aboutrealistic characters, heroes journeys or character arcs. It will appeal to people who like sound-byte stories with flashy scenes that lack substance and nuance. It suffers from all of the sins of the Disney trilogy, except it has no pre-existing heroes to run into the ground. Baby Yoda, Mando and the short guy are the only consistently decent characters. Cara Dune was farcical in her first appearance but was better in ep7-8. If they're female, they're consistently ridiculous in order to pander to those that subscribe to identity politics. This will make these stories date quickly (within 10 years probably). They ignore everything that makes the Original Trilogy both classic and timeless. This is Abraham's style over substance. Disney can not make good Star Wars. This does not bode well for those who like true heroes or realistic characters. It doesn't even meet the standard of the prequels. 6/10 is very fair.

This is what you call a "Hook"!
schuylerdoub15 November 2019
The pilot episode did exactly what a pilot episode is supposed to do and it did it very well. It set the MC : - bounty hunter. It set world(s) - Alien. And it set plot - steal/rescue the target. Many of the less positive reviews are complaining about pacing or "lack of writing". To these complaints i'd simply say this; It's an intro for heavens sake. Intro's are supposed to be short, if you've ever actually read a book with an intro it's usually less than a handful of pages compared to say, the 15-20 page chapter. A hook, an intro, is not supposed to be a feature length film! As for a "lack of writing", a lack of script =/= a lack of writing. sometimes silence speaks louder than words which I believe is precisely the point of this character. He reveals (in a remarkably short period of time) Both a complicated and mysterious past which we as the viewers want to discover, and at the same time a very human side who can be snarky, frustrated, kind and angry. Hell this helmeted character has shown more personality in his 30 something minutes of screen time than Kylo has in both his films!

Don't go into this expecting your mind to melt from some heavenly, awe-inspiring quality and you'll be very pleased. This pilot has done everything I hoped they'd be able to portray, badassery, good fight scenes, hints of a backstory and a quality mysterious cliff-hanger. So far it deserves high praise considering we're critiquing a 37 minutes episode right now.

And if the only thing you can criticize is CGI then GTFO and go back to watching that Pocahontas rip-off, Avatar.

Epically bad
mystang-7024719 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I don't quite understand all the positive reviews for this show. While it has a few redeeming qualities as a whole it is epically bad. The acting and writing is just plain horrible. Cliches abound with forced dialogue and even worse execution. A ruthless bounty hunter that goes soft over a baby? The main premise of the show doesn't even make sense. It is a bit like a slow motion train wreck that I can't stop watching.

Very overrated. I feel like Mando (really??) is just walking around each episode, without any emotion what so ever, he needed to lose the helmet back in episode 1. Need to stop just introducing new characters for every episode and let them carry on in the story.

A little bit dissapointed
sul-fly198015 November 2019
I was expecting a series with a lots of episodes ( like 10 - 20 ), at least 45 min long each, to have enough time to develop the story.

Instead it's a show with 8 episodes, 30 min long each. Too short to create something interesting, something you cant wait to see the next week, year. ( like was the GoT first season for instance ).

For me it looks more like a YouTube fan-made show instead of the " real thing ". The SWTOR ( mmorpg game ) bounty hunter story-ark is 10000000 better than this:)

in-imdb-113 January 2020
Which I am not. The main character is boring at all levels, starting with his ridiculous helmet that seems glued to his face. Anyway, I tried watching the first two episodes and Had a hard time refraining from pressing fast forward (I confess I eventually did press fast forward though). What a mess. What a bore. Must be a private joke for insiders or whatever.

The Best Show Since Narcos and Breaking Bad
smithpaulusmc15 December 2019
The Mandalorian (2019) Run Time: 40 Minutes Log Line: "A lone bounty hunter sets out across the galaxy to complete a notoriously difficult hunt and return the prey to his dubious employer."

The last thing George Lucas expected when he created the Star Wars universe in the mid 1970's was a highly anticipated, episodic series following a bounty hunter, but that is exactly what happened. The Mandalorian, a sci-fi odyssey starring Narcos veteran Pedro Pascal, debuted with the launch of Disney Plus in mid-November 2019. The series is a welcomed change to the Star Wars universe which, up to this point, had felt worn-out and too tightly focused on its franchise characters. The Mandalorian is a different tale that centers on a nameless bounty hunter who exudes coolness and tranquility under fire. Pedro Pascal lends his voice to the character effectively, maintaining a calm demeanor no matter the situation. The first episode quickly, but not hurriedly, gets through setting and character introduction and puts the anti-hero out the door searching to cash in a bounty that has previously been impossible. At the same time, the pilot expounds on the in-depth culture surrounding Mandalorians and their history, a move that lends a great deal of content to be delivered in future episodes. The Mandalorian does not waste the viewer's time with exposition and needless dialogue. It instead keeps the viewer dually engaged in both characters and story, a perfect harmony that every show wishes to accomplish. As such, I am extremely excited to pick back up on episode two as soon as I can.

Finally something in the Star Wars universe that is watchable
skintone-3860010 December 2019
This show is a really entertaining space western, and whether it is Star Wars or not, it is really great to watch in its own right. I was reluctant to even start watching as I was so disappointed with all the Star Wars movies lately. But this is great. The atmosphere, the slow burn feel of it is great. Also something really curious. I would never have thought that a whole series where the main character's face is hidden behind a mask could work This has proved me wrong, and I'm glad !

Starwars and Old Western like
a-kastenas7 December 2019
This is great TV series. To my big surprise, after all the recent theatre releases I could not expect anything of a great value from the franchise. I was wrong.

The narrative evolves a mysterious mandalorian bounty hunter. A flawed hero of questionable morals later in the series redeems his initial impression by revealing his Honor, Justice and even a bit of empathy. All thanks to the newly found little companion, that draws a new vector in lone man's life. A life that will likely to bring us many more adventures and stories.

What I enjoy the most that this TV show does not blindly follow the modern trends of Starwars film making as it takes its inspiration from the first few movies if the Saga.

Series offer a blending of Nostalgia from the older Star wars movies and borrows some elements from traditional old Western movies. We can also spot a few "Tarantinian" vibes from this masterpiece to my surprise.

In general it has all the qualities to become a masterpiece. It's fun, it's mysterious it's rich of Starwars lore and most of all - it's enjoyable.

After watching 4 or 5 episodes I am still wondering if we are going to see the face of the mysterious Mandalorian.

So far its a solid 9/10 and perhaps 10/10 for the fans of Sci Fi and Starwars like myself.

Do not miss out on this one. Mandalorian brings new life to the franchise and is likely to leave a very positive, possibly cult like following later on.

Star Wars just got better
LCNaidoo16 November 2019
I'm always skeptical with all these new movie ideas because only the minority will survive a critical review of which The Mandalorian derserves a standing ovation. In my opinion the movie length contributes to The Madalorian's success with the first episode running just under 40min & the second at +30min and offcourse the movie score is brilliant, keeping you entertained and immersing one within the movie itself.

Finally Real Star Wars!
phantomxtube13 November 2019
The plot of the Mandalorian is very interesting or unique at the very least. This show keeps away from borrowed plots from previous Star Wars movies, unlike the latest installments of Epidode 7 and 8. Mandalorian focuses on one character, a Mandalorian bounty hunter, similar to Solo. That being said, the production quality and writing is much superior to both Solo and the new Star Wars films. I finally feel like I am watching an original Star Wars storyline which is very refreshing. The pilot leaves me wanting more, and hoping the second episode continues from the strong start with Chapter 1.

Good pilot
darshanponna-8879312 November 2019
The Mandalorian started well hope it continues through out. Not a 10/10 though. Story is fast paced. One of the decent pilots in recent times. As a star wars fan I loved this story telling waiting already for next episode.

Once upon a tine in the west of the galaxy...
GIOSER112 November 2019
Favreau and Filoni give all the western style to the new product from the Star Wars franchise, and it's very refreshing. All is here, the vehicles, the usual faces, the droids, etc. Everything you love from this franchise is back!

But now here everything works for the good, with a simple and direct premise we follow our favorite bounty hunter in his quest for find a very mysterious asset with all the fun and the action you'll expect.

Just spacial western fun!

Looks and Feels like Star Wars in all the right ways.
allengore12 November 2019
This is a non-spoilers overview of the 1st episode. First off, it manages to have tons of classic Star Wars homages without feeling like it was placed their for nostalgia's sake. Something the sequel trilogy can learn from. It's jammed packed with creatures and accents that are probably closest to Return of the Jedi in looks - which is a good thing. The humor works as well, it's not humor as in cheap jokes to break tension (like Marvel), but the small amount of humor here is more about light-hearted or witty banter, like the original Star Wars. So far, a show like this blurs the lines between what we expect from a movie versus a TV show. Certainly with content like Game of Thrones out there, we've been inching closer to that indistinguishable difference, but the Mandalorian cinematically is above and beyond most TV shows out there. The biggest difference being that while many shows in the first 15 minutes feel as cinematic as movies but eventually go to exposition and over-the-shoulder cut views - The Mandalorian stays at cinematic movie quality visuals throughout its 42 minute runtime. The pacing is also interesting since it feels like it's taking its time and not pandering to get every main actor in the show right away. I was surprised at how much it can exist as a stand alone show was well. Certainly, there is more to mine there if you are familiar with SW (but let's face it, is there anyone on Earth that isn't already?).

Ok, so far. But the music is distractingly horrible!
firedogdave21 November 2019
I don't know if it's the strange tuning of the instruments or the fact that it seems like it's music from the 1970s Bee movie but, the music is absolutely distractingly horrible!

Was the budget all blown on special effects and they couldn't afford anything on a composer who is not psychotic?

I don't know if I can stand watching it, even if the story line gets better.

They recycled the Piglizard from Galaxy Quest!!! That show was robbed of one of the coolest /ridiculous props in sci-fi movie history. And the rest just as laughable but NOT in a funny way. The most experienced bounty hunter is a moron on every level. I'm on episode 3 and I was convinced he was supposed to be a she. Maybe it is a flamboyant gay character. All crap ideas recycled reheated. Looks and feel like a fan movie soooo cheap and stupid. The Yoda gremlin? Seriously??? And the Piglizard, The PIGLIZARD!!! Ahahahahahahaha

Amazing show
VegiStromman12 November 2019
The Mandalorians first episode was pretty great. The world builiding and the style is Incredible. This show feels like the original Star Wars movies and I love it. It's gritty and dirty. The Mandalorian was a cool character and all do he didn't have that much character development in the first episode, I think he will get more of it in future episodes and we'll get introduced to more characters. Overall a great first episode of a show that I think is just the start of something amazing. Can't wait for the rest of the episodes.

It has potential
bizlats12 November 2019
From the start you can see the budget for this was $$$$$$ huge it has CGI & Sp Effects on a par with some big budget movies. Like one other post I felt it was a bit short on length run time is only 39 minutes most pilots now run 50 to 60 minutes. Overall it has potential to be a good show if you are a Star Wars fan this will fill the gap till the next movie. And it should be interesting to see if it can survive without a light sabre being drawn as none were evident in Ep 1.

Very Disney -- they tried but failed
marcinlysakowski-992794 February 2020
It looks good, that's definitely a plus. All the stories are FULL of MAJOR holes. Terrible. Loads of feel-good disney music every time a village is saved from bad guys. Costume design is poor. Everything that's supposed to be dramatic is only dramatic because of dramatic disney music rather than any thought put in place. Most of the plot is just silly and childish, makes no sense. I think this is targeted at young kids aged 6-10 maybe. That demographic would probably love it. If you expect little from it you'll probably enjoy it, but don't get your hopes up like I did by reading raving good reviews for it. Unfortunately it's a complete flop.

It's Star Wars Tapas and it's great!
liamgrundy5 January 2020
Well, the trilogy of the trilogies is now over and the Saga is complete, but there is still a universe full of space wizards and alien Bounty Hunters with their own stories to tell and boy did they tell it well here.

This was an epic undertaking, keeping in with cannon and d'othing the cap to the Star Wars Universes fanities, this western, samurai, space knight with a code of conduct that is alien but somewhat completely understandable (I mean who doesn't truly wear a mask all day anyway!) was the tonic that I never knew I needed. I was excited (and equally nervous) for this because they could've got it so wrong, but they didn't, they created something independent and pure and without a Skywalker in sight. I really enjoyed the whole 1st series, but the final episode was a special effects all you can eat buffet of just pure brilliance, i just watched the last 2 episodes and I feel like I've been the movies to see a film that I didn't know that I really wanted to see.

Great job and totally enjoyable from the start, this has made a Star Wars fan out of me all over again and has even given me and my son a good and wholesome show that's exciting, funny and without unnecessary gore to watch and enjoy together. I was open to any ideas to help to unglue his head from his Nintendo Switch congratulating his friends on snipering head shots into poor unsuspecting people, so I'm glad it's Star Wars that did it.

The Director and creature Jon Favreu has created something phenomenal and just shows that he must truly love the original source material to create something so pleasing to watch, I'm excited to see where they take the show and just so very glad to be taken along for the ride.

Excited for season 2....

I gave this a 10/10 because it was just brilliant and far beyond anything else I've seen recently.

I have spoken
damorejj3 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
Excellent show, this is what Star Wars should be. Every episode has me interested and engaged. While I wasn't thrilled with the 6th one, the rest have been almost perfect, and baby Yoda makes the rather emotionless Mando seem human. Every character is being developed well though I must say I'm very upset to see Kuiil lost. In the few episodes he was in I grew rather fond of him. I'm hoping a few of you who read this will get his special quote in the title of my review.

One disappointment however with this series which I feel is a missed opportunity for Disney. This series takes place roughly 850 years before the events of Return of the Jedi. The way that's figured is Yoda is 900 in ROTJ, and in this show he's 50. Yet all the technology, uniforms, weaponry, ships, even saloons are exactly the same almost a millenium earlier (In "The Gunslinger" Mando meets the young bounty hunter in the same bar that Luke Skywalker meets Han Solo). While I'm sure it wouldn't probably feel like Star Wars without seeing Storm Troopers in their iconic white helmets or tie fighters with their screeching whirl through space, I find it hard to believe that nothing has changed in almost a thousand years . This show is an incredible opportunity to experience how some of the key aspects of the Star Wars universe came to be! As the first ever Star Wars introduced us to the Death Star which had just been completed, this show could've had us witness the birth of the X-Wing or the beginning of the Storm Trooper program. I personally just think it would be incredibly cool to see how these huge parts of the saga were developed. It just seems like in 850 years the technology hasn't advanced at all which is pretty odd since it develops so rapidly in reality. Just my opinion.

Otherwise the show is outstanding and I'm really looking forward to Season 2.

Baby Yoda made me watch the first season I could not refuse
sagar-swapna2 January 2020
Baby Yoda is the reason I rated this season a 7 else it was a 5 for me. Ok first of all I admit I have not watched the old star wars movies only watched the new ones and they are all average at best. After watching this season only one thing came to my mind 'Fan Service'. This is made for the die hard Star Wars fans only. Negatives - cheap sets come on Disney spend some money learn from Netflix. All the characters are one dimensional nothing interesting or exciting about any of the characters except baby yoda. How the hell everyone walks normally in different planets and can breathe the air do all the planets they visit have same gravity and air to breathe ? All the aliens look cartoony what the heck make up artists. Mandalorian always travels in clean space with backdrop of stars dude at least put some variety with space debris and other space stuff. Television is a long format game where conversation among characters is necessary to know the depth of a character but no all the characters talk in one liners with almost no emotions. It took 8 episodes for them to finally reveal the larger plot which we already knew great. Disney was so cheap that they only made 30 min episodes and the fans still loved it. I cannot be a blind fan. Mandalorian is all the hype with very few substance. It has few catchphrases that I like. Positives - The cute Baby Yoda. I hope I have not offended the fans.

The Best Star Wars since Star Wars
fozzie-9537431 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
This is the best Star Wars Series/movie since the original Star Wars Trilogy. The Last Jedi was OK but this was so original, funny and actually brought tears to my eyes. The characters were brilliant and loved the IG droid in the last episode. The armorer was awesome. The series showed depth in characters and feelings and went away from the PC rubbish of the last lot. Well done to Jon Favreau for his writing and also getting Taika Waititi to direct the last episode, brilliant. Kia Kaha

Cruelty to muppets......
s327616929 December 2019
Aside from the cruelty to muppets who get beaten and vaporised (at least Kermit has not been zapped to date) The Mandalorian is actually a reasonable, if not exceptional watch.

On the upside, this series has decent episodic stories that build on each other plus excellent full on action.

On the downside there's nothing terribly intelligent to be found in this series . Characterisations are a bit flat with a comic book vibe.

That said, at least this series knows what it is and plays to its strengths.

Well I just finished season 1 and if they don't make a season 2 it will be the biggest dissapointment since firefly got cancelled!

This is what star wars has been about since day 1, the entire team has performed beyond any expectations of a TV program. I wouldn't have changed a single thing, and I enjoyed every minute. If your going to watch anything, make sure you don't miss this! P. S. Mogwai may need to fight back to regain their cute factor status after this!

Success lies in the simplicity
webbox-893-55194926 December 2019
This modern approach to the loved franchise, across generations, lies in a simply but heart-warming story, lore-loving set design and fantastic minimalistic dialogs.

# Story: Its basically Lone Wolf and Cub, set in a Sci-Fi-western scenario. # Characters: Every one, good and bad, are driven by own, understandable motivations. Religion, Traumata, Greed, Hate # Set-Design: Every piece of technic is celebrated, from a simple Blaster, to armours, vehicles, spacecraft's and gadgets. # Dialogue: Reduced to the very essence, and lacking any fillers, but not lacking humour.

Overall: It's the BEST modern approach to Star Wars, I have seen so far.

To myself and to put my view in perspective: The Empire Strikes Back is my all-time favourite, I adore A New Hope and Return Of The Jedi, and Rouge One was ok. Everything else I simple ignore.

Highly overrated
aysinbalik19 December 2019
Series opens up with our mysterious and ''badass'' mc -who is in a morally gray area -as he is a bounty hunter with a rough past- beating up some alien rednecks in an alien bar. This scene is also in the trailer. Off with great original content. As you expect show continues to work with such unique stand-alone plots each episode. Now they don't always show you how our mc does his badassary, there are also characters to give exposition and react to this two dimensional anime character. Plots and characters are pretty simple, underdeveloped and fairly predictable but also inconsistent. Mandalorian is this Mary Sue of male mc's. You get this from the first episode. Mysterious, brutal, badass, but a good-guy-deep-inside, anti-hero type. But somehow he trusts this guy he wasn't suppose to, or talk about his traumatizing childhood to a random character. Most of the characters are two dimensional and can't much be said about them. They just act to serve the plot with no real motivation.

A lot of the acting is bad. You may think there isn't much to Mandalorian's acting but they even f'ed that up. This guy doesn't show facial expressions I get it it. But the posture, movement and the damn walking they all look wrong. Like the guy can barely move in that costume. Everything is so stiff. They clearly dubbed him after the shoots, they tried to establish some movements as he speaks but it looks so fake. Even in a scene, I think they removed some lines later or something and add new ones but f'ed the editing too so he wobbles his head at random without lines and the next scene they put him on a loop and he acts like an instagram boomerang post.

CGI is okay for a TV show but still overall not good. Stage combat sucks, looks very stiff. Barely works with all the cuts. Cinematography is good. Shots are interesting, something to look at. Retro scene shifts would worked even better if the show was actually good but OK. After episode concept art is pretty cool, makes me think; instead of making this a TV show, you could make it a visual novel or something and it would be better. As it is now this has good chance at Disney Channel.

It's the only series that I care enough to keep up with. I'm not a Breaking Bad or a Game of Thrones guy at all. Watched some Flash, Gotham, and Walking Dead more recently but stopped.

As for Star Wars, this is better than all the new stuff. I love the shout outs to the many things from the classic Star Wars too. This is Bounty Hunting excellence! Those giving it a bad review, call it meh (I hate that stupid word), or say it's for kids are complete morons. This show is awesome.

Best thing since sliced bread! Of course not all episodes are perfect, you would expect it of any if not all series on the entire planet!

But still they are still enjoyable. There are highs and lows, but you know it always ends on a big high! Makes you want to watch more! It's a very intelligent series... But it has set some holes that need to be filled in, in the StarWars canon. That being a Mandalorian never takes off his helmet in front of others or have it removed by others. Both Star Wars Rebels, and Clone Wars got some questions that need answering.

But still I forgive it for great story and Casting!

Star Wars becoming less Feminine after Disney take over
nadun_don14 December 2019
Rey & Jyn Erso reminded me watching previous Disney plots around a princess & her adventure with cosmetics and decorations.

this doesn't mean that i don't like Pocahontas Frozen or Inside Out..etc Disney feminine stories but those are NOT Star Wars layouts. Disney did wrong to LucasArts products after purchase: there have been many canons and games expanded universe. The Old Republic, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Kyle Katarn all of them are written inside Star Wars inertial frame.

JJ Abrams tried to implement that Force concept but in Episode VIII Disney gave direction to Ryan Johnson to do experiment things that he'll make Disney profitable by making Star Wars a kids toy selling commodity.

Happy to see how The Mandalorian is written (No Jedis or Force prioritized since it is a BountyHunter/Smuggler focused story telling like Han Solo) and hope Disney would learn their mistake and involve more of George Lucas team members like "Dave Filoni" in their further projects.

after 2014 Season 6 of The Clone Wars series good to know Disney is going to continue the show in 2020; I am curious about the Mandalorian story telling & it's future crossover in Star Wars universe reveling the connection of Franchise Events and Canons regarding:
Yoda species baby birth should mentioned during The Clone Wars 2020
Mandalorian "Purge" during clone wars & separatist Army (so teen Mando young days should appear in The Clone Wars 2020)
mentioning of Han Solo somewhere in Future seasons since he's well known among smugglers after Episode VI events..etc

mra-624726 December 2019
First of all let me start by saying I love this show, it is everything I had hoped for in a Star Wars TV series and more. Just one issue though. The Mandalorian has been in at least three different cantinas so far and there hasn't been a single lick of music playing in any of them! Where are my Cantina bands? Where is Sy Snootles?! If you're listening Favteau I demand Cantina music!

I have loved Star Wars ever since seeing the trailer for it in the movie theater. The Mandalorian is just fantastic. I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't ready to be critical since I could hardly believe it was actually going to happen. When the first episode began life got better and it didn't not disappoint. It's just great the feel is nostalgic while managing to be fresh, it's an A+, a 10 , five stars , yes and YES!

EPISODE 4
raykuanlabel-291-47341030 November 2019
Another incredible exciting chapter. Literally I had goosebumps from start to finish. So happy to rediscover Bonnie & Clyde in this epi thru Gina Carano and Pedro Pascal - best duo in a long time on both movies and TV screens. Every journey has struggles, and baby Yoda and Mando's is no exception and this is why I do not see it as a filler. It is the most brilliant idea to incorporate baby Yoda in the show because it makes Mandalorian's mission truly grand and epic, thus the perfect reason why Mando deserves his own series. Also, there is a lot of fun and funny scenes most especially the hissing Garfield cat at baby Yoda. The AT ST action scenes was badass. Overall, a heartwarming episode. Looping it until chapter 5 comes out.

The Mandalorian= Disney Perfection!
itsactuallyamanda16 November 2019
I am not the biggest fan of Star Wars but when I got the chance to watch The Mandalorian with my Disney+ subscription, I felt as if I was in for a treat and indeed I was. The Mandalorian was very well executed and for a TV series directed by Jon Favreau, it was one-of-a-kind and every time you watched, you felt as if you were being transported to the Star Wars universe and you felt as if you were part of the story which is something that is a major plus for any TV series.

Star Wars is Star Wars. This delivered. You also have no credibility to speak on what you thought was intent to shorten the episodes. Probably will be one of the shorter episodes of the season as they didn't want to give away too much. As for the final scene, it was the perfect ending and culmination to the episode. Second episode is also on Friday. Then every Friday from then. Imbecile.

As a Star Wars fan I was very pleased with the first episode. It had a 1977 Star Wars atmosphere to it, beautiful scenery, alien bar, ice planet, desert planet and riding a funny blurrg. Other bounty hunters, awesome IG-88 looking robot spinning and blasting bad guys. As a Star Wars fan you won't be disappointed, neither will the Sci-Fi fans. So looking forward the next episode.

I was waiting for that scene where a woman would kick the ass of the most badass guy in the galaxy. Zero stars. Not watching feminist nonsense or anything else 'progressive'.

Absolutely amazing!
pastorchrisrussell12 November 2019
We all fell in love with the character of Boba Fett despite the fact that he had so little screen time. There was something about the armor, the mysterious voice coming from underneath the helmet, and all the cool gadgets. We all wanted more, but sadly he would be short lived. Not this time. The Mandalorian gives us that look into the life of a bounty hunter and rekindles our love for the culture of Mandalore. A cross between a gritty western and the Star Wars universe we all love. It's perfectly done with an interesting story, fantastic visuals, and nice little surprise. I can't wait to see where they take this show.

Boring as hell.
lkmschulz4 February 2020
I was so hyped for this but now that I've watched the first 3 episodes I don't at all want to continue watching. I don't know if that is just the style of this series but nothing really happens. I could easily sum up ever episode so far in under 2 minutes without missing anything that I think is important.

I guess for some this can be a really good series but I think I have more fun just starring at my black tv for the same time...

Setting over everything else
madameminty1 February 2020
There's no actual plot. Every single character is at best one-dimensional. Things happen because banal clichés collide, cause shootouts, then leave the scene fundamentally unchanged. Conflicts arise because people are stupid.

The setting feels very genuine and eye candy, so there's that.

Is it better Star Wars than the recent movies? Yes. Is it better entertainment? Also yes. But think about it: this is not saying much, now is it?

This is good only for setting-starved, die hard fans with no reference. Also for door murder fetishists. Otherwise? I've found myself hoping it would end sooner.

Now THIS is Star Wars!
ajzeg1 February 2020
The Mandalorian is probably the first Star Wars thing since Return of the Jedi That has accurately captured the look and feel of the original trilogy. The Force Awakens felt like it but didn't really look like it, Rogue One looked like it but didn't really feel like it, The Mandalorian does both! The action is thrilling, the episodes tell fun pulpy adventure stories with memorable new characters (with The Child - Baby Yoda - usually stealing the show), and it expands the lore of Star Wars in interesting ways. Some episodes go for long stretches with no dialogue, all visuals, very similar to Samurai Jack, but the show also feels like a spaghetti western. It is about bounty hunters and indigenous cultures and lawless, wild planets, after all. The effects are almost on-par with the movies, the music is probably the most interesting and unique Star Wars score ever written outside of the 9 movies, and it leaves you wanting more! This is my new favourite show, my favourite Star Wars project since Disney bought the franchise and it is well worth getting Disney+ for! This is the way. I have spoken.

A New Beginning at the Beginning
adrianjean30 January 2020
Just when you thought it was all over, there's more. Answering questions you didn't realize you had, and giving you details within the series you were unaware the Star Wars franchise had kept from us all. This is the only reason Disney+ was worth it. Every loves a good origin story.

A hard act to follow. Bar raised!!
contecrux-984-19119030 January 2020
If you're looking for something to make you fall back in love with Star Wars, it's this gem. So many have tried, some failed, some got close... but this smashes it out the park! With comedy special effects and a well written script, this has been fine tuned all the way to aged and weathered weapons to not too flashy wardrobe. Give it a chance, get over yourself because if you do, you'll remember why you loved it as a kid. Well done.

Great music and a nice layout from show to show. Reminds me of the structure of Cowboy Bebop in how each episode has its own storyline but then there is still a backstory that it keeps coming back to.

Brilliantly written series
nezperdianchaos29 January 2020
I just started watching this T.V. Series and it is just so phenomenal, it's Awesome, no other words can express how well written this series is!

Din Djarin needs to be added to the Star Wars App called, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, because he would be the first Bounty Hunter to be on the Light Side, and this might also get fans interested in The Mandalorian Series.

This is the Way, this is the way I Have Spoken.

Boba Fett's replacement
T-ZER029 January 2020
I was going to give Disney Star Wars a chance at first when I heard there was going to be a Boba Fett movie. I thought, maybe it'll be better than Solo and Rogue One. But that movie was cancelled in favor of this show. Which has Boba Fett's replacement. Now I'm sad again. 😢

timothythom26 January 2020
I really enjoyed season 1! Great character development, great action, sets, well done! The references and poking at star wars character themes in other movies are hilarious. The characters have lots of depth and I like how the main character has a lovely mix of duty, honour, heart, and knows when and when not to break laws and social lines keeping with his honourable character. I'm exited for the next season, keep it up!!

A nod to the original Star Wars! Superb!
hemipristis26 January 2020
Given Disney's recent hits and misses in the Star Wars realm, I wasn't sure what to expect when I set down to watch it. I was very, very pleased! The Mandalorian series managers to harken back to the gritty, original, Star Wars movie that begat the legend. Plotline, cast, acting, cinematography, sound, it's the first, imho, to achieve such a feat. If you are a fan of the first three, watch this series!

A special nod to the acting chops of lead Pedro Pascal, who maintains a convincing performance, even undstated subblties, despite never taking off his body covering.

Wobbly start, fantastic finish
boris_unanimate24 January 2020
I gotta admit, I was not thinking I'd grow to like and enjoy this show. I felt like Ep. 1 was tedious, boring and mere fan service. It felt very forced. The following 2-3 episodes got better, but didn't hold my attention or interest. Only halfway through the season did it pick up and get engaging as well as get better at storytelling.

I liked the casting choices, and even the bad ones were tolerable. I liked the tone and color grading as well. I'm not a Star Wars fan, but this show is what's best about SW since the original trilogy. The last 2 episodes picked up the pace and made it great. Not among the best shows of 2019, but well worth checking out, even if you're not a fan.

Simply phenomenal...
paul_haakonsen23 January 2020
Right, well yeah, I grew up on "Star Wars" and have been loving it ever since "Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope", and I am still loving it today. So when "The Mandalorian" was announced, I was thrilled.

And now having sat through the entire first season, I must say that I am impressed and I am entertained, and I am enjoying this tremendously. Creator Jon Favreau is definitely on to something here with this series; something that is as close to the original trilogy as it can be. And man, this is phenomenal.

The storyline is interesting and has a good variety to it, so there is something for everybody, ranging from classic "Star Wars" action in terms of duels, gunfights, space combat, and such - you know what I mean here.

And "The Mandalorian" offers a nice insight into the term of being a Mandalorian, as they have been fairly poorly portrayed for the average public and casual viewers, anyone not well-traversed in the universe of "Star Wars". I mean, this show made one of my friends come up and say to me, 'I thought Mandalorians were evil, but it is a way of living, a mentality, a creed'.

The special effects in this TV series is good, but as if there ever were any doubts with Lucasfilm and Disney being behind the project. And it has that classic "Star Wars" feel to it, but with an added multiple layers. They managed to make it a tad more gritty and also have that classic Western feel to it. And it works marvelously in favor of the series.

As for the main character, the Mandalorian, aka Dyn Jarren, well he is interesting, and there are some really nice qualities and touches to the character, and I must say that Pedro Pascal portrays the helmet main character quite well. While he is the main character, there is no doubt about the fact that the child - as the public dubbed 'baby Yoda' - has stolen the show. And what is not to like? He is so awesome, cute and he wields The Force. I liked the child from the very first time we saw him on the screen, and with each episode my liking has just grown and grown.

"The Mandalorian" plays on all the right buttons for a fan of the "Star Wars" universe, especially when they brought stormtroopers, scout troopers, death troopers and the TIE fighter into the series. That just felt right; it felt like coming home.

Now, the series is not carried by Pedro Pascal alone, there are some nice acting performances by the likes of Carl Weathers, Werner Herzog, Gina Carano and Nick Nolte, to mention the most prominent of performers. They have a great cast, and people perform quite well, bringing the characters to life in this rich and vibrant universe.

The props and costumes are spot on, and there are so many amazing details in every episode. This helped bring the "Star Wars" universe out on the screen in such a great way.

I have seen every episode three or four times; the first time around for the storyline, then going back to watch it for the details. Plus, I must admit that the show is entertaining enough to support multiple viewings.

This is certain winner for the "Star Wars" universe, and it was a much needed addition to the franchise. I am rating it a solid ten out of ten stars.

The old school authentic Star Wars is back!
mike_moor23 January 2020
'The Force Awakens' felt like it was made for the wrong kind of audience, of which I am definitely not a part of. The Mandalorian feels like the old school, authentic Star Wars. It is miles apart from the new Star Wars movies that mostly have some form of identity crisis.

The Mandalorian easily grabs your attention, much like the old school Star Wars movies. Interesting story, interesting tech, interesting characters, and overall very interesting! Absolutely looking forward to the second instalment of this great series!

Best Star Wars content of the last 35 years.
geezerwinfrow211-511-29863723 January 2020
It's difficult to believe it's been that long since the original trilogy ended, but it's true. What sets The Mandolorian apart is its influences. Lucas created a whole universe to tell a familiar type of story based on the Saturday morning serials of Flash Gordon and the hero's journey storytelling structure of Joseph Campbell. Jon Favreau has created a modern spice version of a 1950s or 1960s western TV drama like Gunsmoke, Rawhide, Lancer, or Have Gun Will Travel. The effect is brilliant.

The only central character is The Mandolorian, who is nameless and faceless, like an old Clint Eastwood character. His traveling companion, the kid, baby Yoda or whatever, is equal parts adorable and mysterious. They make an interesting pair, traveling the galaxy looking for work or for solitude or for shelter from an endless sea of troubles. There are several recurring characters, who appear only as needed. There are notable actors appearing in each episode, but who disappear as the Mandolorian moves on.

The show is less concerned with character development than most modern shows. I think it's a welcome departure. There is mystery around the character. I hope the show retains that mystery. My strongest criticism is that a backstory is provided at all. Still, the show has the look and feel of both Star Wars, and a western drama. It's brilliant.

Pretty good with lots of potential
ericks-8689221 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
I enjoyed the show, but I'm not going to say it's perfect. The effects aren't always great, sometimes it's slow, but overall it's very good. Good action, interesting characters, and despite what people bailing on the show halfway through the season would have you believe, many of the episodes tie together nicely at the end.

What gets me really excited is that this is a show that opens the possibility of exploring my favorite part of the Star Wars lore: the New Republic. How excited will we be when Mando goes to Coruscant and meets Luke or Mara Jade? This show allows the possibility of putting the EU on screen for the first time.

Mediocre at best
leoalshannag17 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
This new Disney show fails to hit the target on so many things, but people still seem to like it. Well, perhaps not people but Star Wars fans. Not a single person who is not a fan of Star Wars has said that this is a well produced show. Even the smart Star Wars fans know that this is not well produced, but the not too smart fans keep eating up anything that Big Corporation throws out just to sell more toys. If this show takes place after the old trilogies (4-6), and before the new ones (7-9), why no mention at all of Baby Yoda? Because he was made up to sell stuff, not to contribute to the plot.

The Mandalorian has a thin storyline, with pretty bad effects, and childish dialogue. Any adult, and especially if you like the old trilogy, cannot in all honesty say that this is a good show for adults. This is something my 12 year old nephew will appreciate, and he hasn't even seen the old trilogies. Now I never understood the Star Wars hype, always thought that it was overrated to produce all this merchandise and praise. It was perhaps great when it came out as it was one of the first movies to use effects in a movie in such a way, even if it looks ridiculous today. But then it was hyped, and the media kept hyping it up...and the majority of the people (who lack intelligence in general) listen to whatever the news tell them is cool, or healthy, or bad for you. And Star Wars got just that. It revived interest in the space program that NASA had, and thus it was in the state's interest to popularise Star Wars. The same with the Beatles. The most overrated band in history, they just happened to be first to sing in that manner...if the Beatles tried to make it today, they would not even get a record contract. They were first, and the state wanted to popularise this new music with new thinking, as to change the view society had of the world. To make children oppose their parents and teachers, and that is exactly what happened. When something keeps getting unwarranted praise and attention, then there is a powerful interest that makes sure to further that this particular person, or movie, or band, keep getting attention.

The Mandalorian suffers from the same issue as The Witcher show. The shows have big budgets, but it seems as if they had the same budget as Xena: The Warrior Princess. This is a major issue, especially when coming from companies that have more than enough money. Netflix should have taken money they give to comedians for crappy specials, and invested more in the Witcher. And the Mandalorian needs to be reworked completely as it has so many flaws.

The magical atmosphere of Star Wars is finally back
anthonyvetaas16 January 2020
Ive been waiting so long, Ive been disappointed so many times, but here we are, a worthy Star Wars series, and not like the garbage we have been presented for years after the first 3 films.

It catches the spirit of the original Star Wars films, and at times goes beyond the genius of those. Lets hope they manage to keep it so, and that we avoid them watering it down in future seasons.

Amazingly exciting, captivating, and a tour through a galaxy a far far away...
Johntrek18715 January 2020
This follows a Mandalorian bounty hunter on his adventure first collecting bounties and then on a mission to preserve the life of a force sensitive child. The series is only 8 episodes, of varying time, and is littered with small references or props to the greater Star Wars universe, post Return of the Jedi. Any fan of the trilogies, story films, comics, novels, etc... will be pleased when ya find an Easter egg, no matter how obvious. This series does a great job of making the universe far far away, feel lived in, and there are so many interesting characters with unique and exciting to tell. This is what Stat Wars should be.

I'm not going to lie, I like Disney Star Wars. Sure not every decision Disney has made with the franchise is good, but I can proudly say The Mandalorian is the best Star Wars show since Clone Wars. The sound effects, puppets, costumes, score, acting and action are all pretty spot-on if not perfect. Every episode felt like a ride and hopefully Season 2 can live up to this Season.

Better than star wars
rozsnyaib31 December 2019
After seeing the last episode of the Mandalorian I am very astonished. At the beginning of the mandalorian I thought that it is ok season, because there wasn't really much happening unless there was a man with a helmet killing people. But in the end it turns out it's really good. So yeah, I recommend this to watch :)

omgakeem31 December 2019
I am not a Star Wars fan, I have watched the original three but nothing past that. I got Disney+ for Christmas so I decided to give this show a watch since all 8 episodes were released, wow was I surprised at how good it is, if you like a lot of fighting and shooting and have a really good story to boot this is for you. This show gets me wanting to watch other Star Wars movies and since Disney+ has them I'm going to take the jump and give them a watch. May the Force be with you, that's all I know from Star Wars.

Star Wars as we liked it !
RealLiveClaude30 December 2019
Though most of the fans hated the last three theatrical movies of Star Wars, I may say here that Jon Favreau got the essence from the very first movies circa 1977-1983.

Great writing and acting (Pedro Pascal makes quite a respectful Mandalorian), special effects at its best and of course the surprising presence of one of Yoda's clan desendants (full of "Force" in small baby, says I...).

As a second season coming, please make it as great.

Final word: happy to see Carl Weathers back and bring back Gina Carano. She was quite a hot thing next to "Mando"...

The Force is still there !

Promising start, then fell short, at the end redeemed itself.
BBogus30 December 2019
The first three episodes were great and then it suddenly became a typical boring procedural TV show aimlessly going through the motions. Luckily it redeemed itself in the last 2 episodes. First season shows it has great potential but hopefully in season 2 they will come up with great writing, story lines and not fall in the procedural tv show trap.

zombiegrl-2964829 December 2019
This isn't just the best thing from the Star Wars universe to be created since the original trilogy, it's literally the best thing I've seen on TV in years! It's absolute perfection! As a lifelong Star Wars fan who, apart from Rogue One, which was a great prequel, had almost lost hope of enjoying anything else Star Wars related, The Mandalorian for me has redeemed Star Wars and restored balance to the force. I pray the second series keeps this level of awesomeness...please keep Ruin Johnson away from it!!

lukasstasch29 December 2019
One can only admire the great characters, music, look and feel of that series. They create unique atmospheres in several situations with great unpredictable storytelling and minimal dialogue. No scene seems boring or unnecessary so that all conversations and actions stick to the main plot. The series made me feel with the protagonist and made me smile in certain parts without really implementing any dumb jokes. Furthermore many shots are made with an extraordinary eye on detail and refreshing twists, always with the spirit of the Star Wars universe.

30 min per Episode is way too short to develop a complex and deep storyline. Nevertheless they succeed in creating amazing tension in each episode.

Not Disappointed...
bheadher28 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Honestly, at first I wanted to give this a 10 right from the start because The Mandalorian brought back all of the emotional feel of the original Star Wars...that's the good part. After mulling it iover for a while I decided I had to be totally honest, so I did drop it to a 9 rating...why you might ask?

The presentation itself is perfect, but that presentation has noticable gaps in several episodes...in other words, the writing dropped off a bit when it comes to maintaining the 'honor' part of the story...don't give up on it though, The Mandalorian does bring back the magic feeling and is very much better than the last three big screen outings...the music ain't bad either...

Yes I hafta say it...LOVE Baby Yoda!

Finally some good Star Wars again
Siemers-Johannes28 December 2019
So far there have been four good Star Wars movies for me: Episode 4 to 6 and Rogue One. Now I can add a series to that list.

The Mandalorian is fun to watch. The action scenes are great. It also has the cutest baby ever. Unfortunately the story through the eight chapters is lacking something. So the series is great, but not superb.

Kind of Charming but Poorly Written
Archimedex27 December 2019
This is not a good story. This is not a 9 stars story. It's just a decent Star Wars story, and Star Wars, like Marvel and Disney content, has too many fans who would rate 10 stars without blinking or thinking. That's why the completely absurd and unfair rating.

The Mandalorian is not the worst Star Wars story ever told.. but it's pretty poorly written, with mediocre characters. Star Wars has never been well written, and this is in no way better than the best Star Wars content out there. I think, more objectively, if you remove all the Star Wars fans who voted here, this would be a 5-6 stars. 7+ stars on IMDb is generally reserved to very good content.

OK, so what's good about this series is the atmosphere, which does evoke the old Star Wars movies. That's it.

I would love to see a really good Sci-Fi series one day, to rival the best TV series out there. I have never seen a single Sci-Fi series that's worth more than 6-7 IMDb stars, if you're kind to it... I really doubt there is one yet.

This character without a face has more character than ones from new movies.

3 episodes in. The main character has yet to even show his face but I already feel more for connected to him that any of the new movie characters. Great action and well written so far! Can't wait to learn more about his story.

My only gripe is the short length because I want more so bad! Episodes are just over 30 mins when you take into account the recaps at beginning of episodes and lengthy credits at the end.

Worth it just for the music
unrealmuscat22 November 2019
First time I am not able to stop the generic at the end of a serie because the music is so good and fresh. It is pure Star Wars universe like the first movie. Even the alien creatures look like puppets (that can be anoying for some). The scenario is similar to a Han Solo mission. I can't say about anything the remaining of the season but the quality is there. Worth the time.

A New Hope
joakim-ericsson22 November 2019
So, it seems Disney have people who DO know how to do classical Star Wars after all. The stuff people really want. Not surprised, as Disney knows their storytelling... When they want to.

Simple but good and timeless hero's journey story. Character, NOT FX focus. Good mix of serious and humor. A protagonist who is mysterious and not very talkative. Classical redemption/moral story so far... Very promising. Don't screw this up!

Don't understand much of the BS in the new trilogy, if you want to reinvent a great concept, you better know it's gonna make it better, not just having a cocky and self-indulgent hunch. Just because you make a ton of money, it doesn't mean you are good at your job :D

Anyway, GOOD STUFF!

Star Wars getting back to normal

This show is very pretty... has a good budget. The characters are true to Star Wars. Nice to see a fitting story, instead of the unwatchable mainstream movies.

wifairs19 November 2019
After watching the first episode, it felt like watching the best Star Wars movie ever, with so much attention to detail & Star Wars Lore, dripping off every scene. Look forward to binge watching the entire series when it is released to DVD. Fantastic stuff !

It's Good
mlittle-2275619 November 2019
As an 80s kid born in 77 I am a lifelong SW fan. The most recent trilogy along with the Solo film have not been good. This however is a breath of fresh air. LucasFilm and Disney...please listen to us fans (now we aren't bots). Good story-telling is all we are asking for and what I've seen so far with this series is what I've wanted and missed as a fan. My only complaint is that the episodes thus far are short but it leaves me wanting more. More of this and less of the other trash please.

The episodes are too short, ep 2 was only 32 mins, really? Most TV shows nowadays da says are 45mins plus easily..leave you wanting a lot more definitely..also not a big fan of Disney's weekly release schedule, tv shows are always better watching everything at the same time, let's you enjoy the story more.

Fantastic start! Great production!
krapriv18 November 2019
This review only covers the first two episodes available at the time.

The Mandalorian has exceeded my wildest expectations.

In general there has always been an element of goof to all of the Star Wars movies and cartoons we've seen. This series doesn't appear to rely on that type of humor, instead there are moments of umph that surprise and delight without feel of being tired or forced.

I am hopeful and can't wait to see what story awaits in the remaining episodes.

The first few minutes alone reminded me of how fun it was to play Star Wars the Old Republic as a Bounty Hunter.

I hope this is the kind of story and production we can expect from Disney going forward. I hope we learn more about the different aspects of the story with the Skywalker saga being lain to rest.

A return to it's original roots
timothyrobertcooke17 November 2019
If only the recent films remembered what made Star Wars great. For kids brought up on only CGI, yes there are 'puppets' here, and sorry if that offends you. A western in space, but a great western at that.

smatthew90917 November 2019
This is a return to the roots. I feel the same when seeing the warhammer Astartes. I've only seen episode one but it feels like the director wanted to keep the original star wars feel alive.

This is only my opinion of episode one so it will most likely change.

How tv series should be?
batuhanyalcn16 November 2019
It is perfect example for a how tv series should be, fiction perfect continues scenes visiual effects are perfects. Actings need more development but role to story also perfect keep going like that it is very appropriate to watch this serie at a break for a week.

A Return to the Force
ae_frenchie15 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
From the very beginning of the first episode it felt like a return to the original movies IV, V, and VI. The originality and quirks of certain characters while bringing back familiar ones is pretty fun to watch. I can't tell you what my heart did when a certain force wielding friend showed off his power for the first time. The pacing is great, the action doesn't steal from the main characters who you really want to learn more about. Well done Disney! I really had my doubts but thankfully this show has redeemed some of the catastrophe of the newer movies.

Almost Great - Still the Out-of-Place Sillies
magicjack15 November 2019
All in all, I'm happy to see this approach. the old west vibe works perfectly and the production visually enticing, however, enough of the overly childish dinks and donks when things hit and silly remarks from the main character. Neither fits this otherwise excellent series and keeps it from being perfect.

More Star Wars than Star Wars
tcehouseproductions15 November 2019
Sorry about the title I meant the sequel trilogy. I just watched the pilot and its excellent. It lovingly has call backs to the original trilogy in the form of the stylistic choices and world building without forcing in hammy character cameos to provoke nostalgia. Good start and props to Disney for using competent creative story tellers and not virtue signaling activists trying force on the nose progressive political messages.

Surprisingly, "The Mandalorian" looks incredibly promising.
asphyxion_14 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Given the kid-friendly orientation of Disney+ (which is a huge gripe that I have; I wasn't going to pay the 7$ to subscribe but decided to get the free trial an opportunity), I was ready to write "The Mandalorian" off as nothing more than a cash-grab 'Star Wars-lite' fluff piece that would be filled with terrible CGI, a contrived cinematic universe, and stale dialogue (a.k.a. a series that would resemble the prequel trilogy). I can't believe how -mostly- wrong my preconceived notions about what my viewing experience of The Mandalorian would be like after watching only the first 40 minutes of the series.

Star Wars fans are going to love this.

In reality, Mandalorian absolutely feels like it's part of the original Star Wars canon--as if Favreau himself were involved in the production of the original trilogy from 40 years ago.

The first episode of Mandalorian contains several nods to bits of the rich lore scattered throughout cinematic universe we know from the films (and even a good chunk from the many books and other entertainment mediums available): the Cantina where we first meet Han Solo and learn about how many parsecs the M.Falcon rates under; the Carbonite slabs used to entrap wanted criminals by preserving them in a cryogenic-like state giving bounty hunters a worry-free way of safely transporting the galaxy's most dangerous ruffians; the various types of Vibro equipment/blasters/carbines that any seasoned Star Wars Galaxies veterans (especially combat medics, teras kasi masters and creature handlers/bio engineers) will nostalgically recognize; a spectrum of species interaction ranging from the near-domesticated, horse-sized Vols to the rocket-sized Krayts capable of destroying anything the size of an office building in two quick bites. There's even a scene showing what exactly happened to some of Hutt Jabba's creepy little minions during a sequence where we see our main character walk past one trapped in a cage as he's traipsing through a Starport bazaar. I was pleased by the world-building in the first episode more than anything else because I felt that it would, apart from the CGI, be the thing that suffered most due to a lack of attention to detail. I couldn't have been more wrong. Jon Favreau loves Star Wars dearly and the essence of the saga's quintessential being shines through in practically every scene we see on screen. Everything you see has a purpose or a point to it. Nothing feels forced, artifical or bloated -- something that I thought the prequel trilogy was rife with and ultimately suffered heavily from alongside its other massively disappointing flaws (like the painfully abysmal dialogue, scatterbrained timeline and woeful miscasting of a human stone as Anikin, and a type-cast action movie star for Obi).

The other big surprise was the CGI/Animation. Whoever's doing the animation for The Mandalorian deserves some kind of recognition for creating such a mellifluous sequence of effects that look far more genuine than much of the CGI plaguing cinema for the past decade or so. Everything that's animated in this show has a 'weight' and 'impact' to it, which tells me they have an animator who's very knowledgeable about physics/fluid dynamics and adept at translating that knowledge into 3D rendering--rendering that ends up looking genuine enough to never question if it's actually fake. Most of the time, our senses are accosted by 3D rendering where the objects being rendered look like floating, elastic toys with rounded/smooth features (ie. devoid of edges or angles that would give them a realistic definition/appearance). A great example is the sequence where we see two Vols being ridden on horseback. The attention to the shape of the shadows being cast by the rider/animal relative to the source of sunlight, the dust being kicked up as the Vols feet hit the ground, the fact that we can actually see the elbows and knees and other angles of the riders/animals, etc. all make for just one of the many CGI sequences that look like they came from a triple-A Hollywood movie. I probably sound like a cinema snob picking the dumbest of nits by elaborating so verbosely on something as trivial as the way pixels are animated on my screen, but for me this lack of authenticity in CGI is one of the primary/#1 continuity and immersion killers for me when watching any kind of fantasy film like Star Wars. Even The Mandalorian's upgraded armor looks like an actual piece of armor (hint: it's not, you can see this in various scenes throughout the show when we only catch small glimpses/pieces of it on screen, as the modified bump mapping reverts to its default state and shows the drab piece of armor the actor actually has equipped for his costume--oops! maybe they'll pay closer attention to this when editing future episodes)

Anyways, enough of my meandering and rambling word-stew. I was pleasantly surprised by The Mando and I'm looking excitedly forward to the rest of the episodes now without having to cross my fingers or bate my breath. Favreau has shown us with this pilot episode that the series is in very good hands. Given Favreau's history of predominately for-adults-only scriptwriting/directing of slapstick sex comedies like 'Slackers' with his buddy Vince Vaughn (whom he is in a bunch of movies with), his ability to elevate The Mandalorian onto its proper pedestal is nothing short of a shocking surprise.

Everything about The Mandalorian has me intrigued and hopeful. This is good stuff. And not only is it good stuff, it's the nerf-herdin' Star Wars that us fans actually NEED. My only real complaint here is that I hate Disney+ for their ridiculous scheduling of their programming. You don't start a premium content streaming service and give us epic programming but then keep that programming on made-for-tv-and-advertising-profits schedule. The episode(s) are only 39-40 minutes long (no i'm not joking) and we don't even get the season released all at once (like every other premium content streaming platform does with their shows). Apple+ is guilty of this nonsense too (like the amazing show See with Jason Mamoa). It's a dirt-poor and painfully-obvious tactic at keeping you subscribed to the service in perpetuity so that you don't get all episodes at once, and then cancel your sub after binging the episodes until next year when you resub to catch season 2 all at once. That isn't good business, it's just a huge pet peeve that makes me want to torrent every episode once the season is complete instead of going through the nonsense of spending 7$ on a platform that only has animated movies (which itself is ridiculous considering Disney owns FX and could easily put titles like Sons of Anarchy/Tyrant/The Shield/Taboo/American Horror Story/Mayans MC/etc. up for streaming if they really wanted).

OK I'll really stop rambling now. I promise. Do yourself a huge favor if you're a SW junkie and give The Mando a shot! :D

tommycloseshomes13 November 2019
First off, Filoni and Favreau are amazing!. I am so glad Filoni finally got his chance at live action. These two should be the future of Star Wars. On to the episode itself, the visuals really put you there! You can feel the cold, taste the dust, smell the engine grease. Pascal did an amazing job relaying emotions through a helmet, strictly with body language. The story is off to a great start, the reveal at the end blew me away, and the little nods to the fans like throwing in references to Life Day and the Mythosaur were wonderful touches. I truly look forward to seeing more. Thank you Disney Plus!

Best Star Wars anthology yet!
calumbis12 November 2019
I wasn't looking forward to this after The Last Jedi, I love Star Wars but since TLJ... well... I had low expectations. Solo was good but it still didn't hit home like the original trilogy... The Mandolorian on the other hand... Hit home like no other film and or show! The main character, is just straight up a bad a**! He doesn't take s**t from anyone and shockingly, I think I like him better than Boba Fett. This Bounty Hunter seems to be an understanding guy with a heart yet ready to blow your head off over a quick buck if need be! And I won't say why I think he has a heart cause I don't wanna spoil the plot, but he is simply amazing. First episode has completely restored my faith in this franchise and I'm so excited to see the second episode! Seriously, spend your money to see this show guys! It's 100% worth it!

magyarfiusrac-3745517 November 2019
This series has a couple of interesting things: The visuals seem quite real and authentic, the make up is good, the Mandalorian's personality starts developping in just two episodes, which is pretty good for character development, baby Yoda is the cutest thing ever... however, the series is terribly boring, whatever's happening in the plot is far from interesting.

The story is subtle at first but you can tell we will have quite an adventure moving forward. From start to finish of these first 39 minutes I was fulling engaged. I love how they keep a good nostalgic feeling of Star Wars in the show without shoving it down the audiences throats. I didn't once feel like this is just cheap garbage Disney made to make easy money. Jon Favreau does a great job at making this story new and refreshing. I am very excited to see what is coming next!

What an amazing return to the roots of Star Wars
mecong-378-2927014 January 2020
All you millennials out there - Star Wars began its long run in 1977 - and The Mandalorian returns to that ancient time - for you that is. The writing is in the style of those days, as well as the storytelling. There is a storyarch which takes time to develop - its similar to those ancient papery things called books which told novels or tales. Its just beautiful. And Episode 8 for all true Star Wars fans had soo much to offer - the darksaber guys! - amazing. So I hope for once Disney will keep this show as it is now and wont develop it into something more appealing to the big spender online demographic. And telling Apollo Creed its a "creed" - loved it.

neilcjenkins28 December 2019
8/10 for Season 1. An excellent but sometimes strange show. Part western, part sci-fi, sometimes slow burn, with some characters who steal the show entirely this is better than any of the last three films.... Solo, Last 💩 Jedi and RotS.

It feels like classic Star Wars and that's its biggest recommendation.

jazz125 December 2019
(sorry about the misspellings I'm from the EU)

This show is so good it's going to spark a Firefly-like cult.

I can spot people discussing and arguing about the show with so much passion - on internet forums, fan sites, "movies.stackexchange" and the like - "does he ever take his helmet off?", "who are the 'shock troopers?" etc. etc.

And trust me, all the "where's the story" disappointment mentioned by some reviewers will be gone by the time you reach episode 7.

It looks like Star Wars, it feels like Star Wars, and it IS the Star Wars we've been waiting for

(unlike the sequel trilogy crap that's even worse than the prequels)

P.S. Oh and here's a shoutout for the closing credits. Can't take my eyes off

jvflores-642506 December 2019
What can I even say. Like everyone else this show alone is worth getting Disney Plus. The direction taken by creator Jon Faverou with Dave Filoni backing him just brings amazing story telling. This is Star Wars, no way around it. If you want the feel of Star Wars broken down into episodes so that it feels like you are watching a 8 hour long movie (8 episodes total) this is for you! The title character alone (no spoilers for the mystery character) is worth the show, I LOVE THE DYNAMIC these two characters have. It's great

BennyTV1 December 2019
Thank you so much for bringing this series in. mr Lucas cant ruin this one... so guess who shot first?? Thats right, our anti-hero.

Ill keep it short. Action scenes and cinematography Are top notch and subtly nostalgic. Lots of new content here, better than some movies. Favreau even approached and brought in some out of the box characters as well.

Finally- a new story, one thAts escaped us for 40 years. This task alone... i mean, cmon. Halfway through... cant wait for the ending. And then the re-watch. Every episode has something- fan or not.

Thank you Jon.

seawolf62630 November 2019
This level of respect is what every Star Wars movie should've gotten. The show screams Star Wars in every aspect... Environments, characters, ships, etc. Jon Favreau saved Star Wars and single handedly made Disney+ a must have subscription.

Amazing.

No Woke - great quality
info-8407123 November 2019
I woke up this morning and felt the need to express my gratitude towards the creators of this little Star Wars addition. To keep it short and simple: throw away all the Woke Disney Star Wars Movies ( women who want to push an agenda, black or other colored people who want to push an agenda) Star Wars movies, only keep this. It has the quality, the potential to push Star Wars back to where it belonged. If only each episode was a bit longer, it would be perfect. But since it does not indulge itself with anti-white/men-women politics (Watchmen hello?) it gets a 10 from me. Great show.

bum_tres18 November 2019
But there is nothing. Dialog is very shallow just like the story itself. Irrelevant spoiler ahead.

He is very expensive high end bounty hunter, yet he accepts only half money for the first job we see. He is so skillful he can beat up 5 people and out shoot dozens, but cant beat a single wild beast. In two episodes got him saved twice , form a wild animal!! cmon, is any one checking the story line? Or is it just add a word game?

Undubitably the best Star Wars since the Empire Strikes Back
domagojpandzic15 November 2019
This is for sure the CLOSEST to original Star Wars of all the movies and shows that were released after the prequels. The feel, the storyline, the music, the practical special effects... Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have created something here something far beyond our wildest expectations and I thank them for that!

P. S. This review is after watching the first two episodes. I sincerely hope that the next 6 episodes will not dissappoint.

Mandalorian Strikes Back!
lootybagsacks13 November 2019
After watching the mess that was The Last Jedi, I had little faith in Disney and Star Wars moving forwards.

After watching the 1st episode of The Mandalorian I have A New hope for the franchise. It eases you into the universe nicely. It feels very Much like old Star Wars. It has some nice shots, cool action, some funny bits and interesting characters.

Anyone thinking it was slow and confusing. Erm, it's a tv series. Who wants to know and see everything in the first episode? Nope!

I'm looking forward to finding out who's who. What they're about and what's going to happen. Brilliant!

Thank you for being back my love of Star Wars.

Forget the movies! Don't bother watching The return of Skywalker. Stick with this and writers who obviously know the universe and enjoy what they're making.

A Star Wars universe I have always wanted
garrettesheets13 November 2019
After the first episode, I must say it is very promising. The only problem is the length of the episode and the animation could be improved, other than that, it seems great. It has a very compelling protagonist that presents a grittier side of Star Wars that many fans have looked for but have only read about in the Extended Universe. I see it as the start of what could be a very promising series.

Chapter 1
ryandonohue-1235412 November 2019
From the very first scene the hooks were on. Episode 1 of the mandalorian grabs ahold of you and doesn't let you turn away until the credits start to roll. Although, even the credits look fantastic. The overall tone fits the show so well and I'm gitty to see the next episode come friday. The twist ending raising questions that I'm dying to have answered. Up until now i was bummed about weekly episodes, now I love it because it allows us to have the chance to breathe and diagnose instead of blowing through each episode. ALSO the score is absolutely perfect.

Not as good as star wars the last jedi and force awakens
jere_zabala13 November 2019
It's not that bad, but the last movies were so EPIC and perfect, that this feels like a involution, this is not the way, possers of course hate the last 2 movies because they are dumb and just go with the masses, but they were the best episodes, and this is just as bad as ROGUE ONE which I also ranked it with 1/10 because it had nothing to do with star wars, this one yes it does has at least some elements of star wars, but, it's not perfect.

Gave it two episodes before I reviewed. Don't believe the bots
Sportgod9817 November 2019
Not good, very little dialogue and what they do have is terrible. Visually it's great because if that it leaves you wanting more to listen too. Scenarios are a bit out there on how they are settled. So disappointed...I'd said for several years, even before it was a movie, that they should have done Solo as a series. Nostalgia, snappy dialogue, and an interesting story/backstory because this just isn't cutting it as a fan. Boring boring boring

Just briefly scanned first 2 episodes, ...
jbelland-9022916 November 2019
I admittedly haven't watched the first 2 episodes because I would rather binge a short series. However, I have scanned through both to get a feel. And I have read many of the reviews - good and bad. And, more importantly, I have also checked out the subtitles available - and just seeing the size of those files caused me concern, which was confirmed by my scanning of the episodes. While I will return for a true review once the series is complete, I expected - from the short subtitle files - that this series was going to have a hard time doing character development because character development is largely developed through dialogue interactions.. Several of the reviews substantiate that this lack of character development is, in fact, the case to date. My scanning of the episodes had difficulty finding very much dialogue at all. Couple that with 30 minute episodes, and you have a recipe for a very slow moving and shallow production. I'm just stating my feelings at the moment and - as stated - I will be willing to update this after (hopefully) making it through all 8 episodes to see if there is more to this then it looks at first glance.

erickenehan-790-91712313 November 2019
If you haven't tried to get me interested in a single character 30 minutes in then I'm out. Also it's shot and broadcast at a high frame rate making it look like a soap opera. Such an unforgivable mistake made by veteran filmmakers. Don't see a reason to continue with Disney plus subscription as of yet.

Beautifully Expands the World of Star Wars.
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-218719 December 2019
The Mandalorian is a pop-cultural milestone: it's the first ever live-action Star Wars television show and it looks like a multi-million dollar film from Hollywood, and has the pacing of a well-done HBO show that refuses to rush things unnecessarily. It's also the flagship show of Disney+. Star Wars finally has everything Star Trek kept boasting about for years: stories covering EVERY discernible medium, including (at long last) serialised live-action tv dramas amongst miscellaneous adaptations throughout the years.

This show rocks: it's a fully-fledged Space Western that honours everything that made the Original Trilogy great by just having seamless world building shown through the title character traversing the galaxy one planet at a time. It doesn't worry about building a bajillion teases for a sequel or whatnot: it just tells a story that happens to be in the Star Wars Universe and its naturally-paced beats and action makes this show a worthy continuation of George Lucas' legacy. The main character never shows his face, but you never need to see it to know that The Mandalorian is a hardened man built by his code of honour, his culture and he's like 'Blondie' from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. He's a firmly-developed badass that he'd probably make Batman quiver (if the two would ever meet at all). The Mandalorian, or simply 'Mando', is a warrior who knows the balance between life and death, code of honour and self-righteousness, tact and recklessness; this guy is one you wouldn't dare double cross under any circumstances because he'll make you pay big time if you betray his trust.

This series is already building up to be something that's more firmly realised and thought-out than The Sequel Trilogy as a whole, and it's a nice expansion of the Star Wars canon overall. Here's hoping that Season Two will get even deeper into the galaxy far, far away: maybe have the Mando take on some outcast Jedi and show the difference between the cultures of the Jedi and Mandalore. There are so many possibilities with this show and its off-shoots in the future that it's fair to say Star Wars has a bright future in live-action television.

If you're trying to find a reason to subscribe to Disney+ or haven't found one yet, this is the reason why it'll get even bigger and better in the future: that's not even including the other non-Star Wars shows on the horizon for the service. It's a good time to be a Star Wars fan and it'll keep getting better on the tv side of things too.

This is the sequel the we all hoped to see. Mr. Favreau Sir, thank you for your talent. I'm thanking to the whole crew as well.

This masterpiece is giving hope to all the fans around the world.

This actually feels like Star Wars
Atanas-Gurkov12 December 2019
Great start, it actually makes you feel you are watching something part of Star Wars, the original. This review was written 5 episodes into the show and so far, I like just about everything about it. The CGI is great and yet they've included some old fashioned tricks like having people inside costumes or droid shells, puppets and mechanical parts that move like there's a human holding and operating it from the back... Details that send you back to the original trilogy. Done tastefuly.

The story is also great. One can still get annoyed by the story development speed and this show is no immune to the good old "give them a small hint and then milk it for a season or two" but that's expected, I guess. Would have rated this a perfect 10 if the story would pick up some speed in terms of the main characters, plot and overall direction. I have no idea where it is going. Not expecting to see any jedi or sith lords but would like to see something related to the force, midichlorians, character origins and abilities soon.

Star Wars for Star Wars fans. This really is the way.
SeriousMayhem12 December 2019
This show isn't very deep or groundbreaking and the story is actually rather simple. And while not always truly perfect in its execution, it makes up for it by being truly and perfectly Star Wars.

Where in my opinion most, if not all, of the Star Wars movies made in the last 20 years, failed to either capture the Star Wars spirit or the Star Wars vibe (or quite frankly, both), The Mandalorian hits it home.

It's entertaining, it's nostalgic. Grab that popcorn and enjoy.

An easy and well-deserverd 9,5/10.

Tv Series Gives Star Wars Some JUSTICE!
aguilaramiguel9 December 2019
I know everyone has their own opinion but I feel like I need to share mine about this TV series. I consider myself a Star Wars fan but the new movies from Disney have been letting my down. I've walked out in theaters due to how predictable and horrible the new movies are compared to Lucas films. But finally, I feel Disney has given Star Wars some justice with this show. I actually feel like I'm watching a Star Wars movie that I grew up with (Lucas). I'm no longer ashamed on being a Star Wars fan due to the horrible Disney movies, I highly recommend this TV show if you like the old Star Wars vibes. I'm just sharing my opinion, because I really do hope Disney continues to make Star Wars like this TV series rather than their crappy new movie series. Sorry.....

Intresting Premis but like all Modern Disney properties ruined by feminism
redspace-397436 December 2019
The hero easily get's beaten up by a woman half his size as does every other male character that ever happens to fight a woman. The initial interesting premise of this show is ruined by Disney insistence of putting identity politics about the supposed superiority of women over men into almost every episode.

For the old timers
Fred_Derf_12 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
It seems that this show was made for a certain part of the fanbase, the ones who prefer a more mature Star Wars tone , darker than what the franchise uses to be most of the time.It's really reminiscent of the old school italian spag westerns in certain scenes, such as the Mandalorian snuffing out dozens of enemies with a heavy mounted gatling blaster in the middle of a desert , inside a small campound wich totally looks like the places we saw in the old spags. That scene was a pure reference to Django (1966 ).The dry humor,the good designs and the small references to the franchise throughout, it's refreshing after so much dull Star Wars movies. Now we'll have to see if it manages to keep that tone in the next episodes or if the Mandalorian becomes a dull ,good guy story.We want Bobba !

STAR WARS SHOULD BE LIKE THE EPISODES WITH PROMETHEUS FROM STARGATE SG-1,ALIEN OR VOYAGER
marian_the_nightman12 November 2019
-I like the new series ,but this looks too weird,the robot should look scary,not like a magic lamp,the ship looks like a space shark or like a whale, the weird ships are just not cool,i miss the old MILLENNIUM FALCON and i really think Pedro Pascal is more suitable to be in a Smokie and Bandit remake instead of Burt Reynolds,because he looks soo ...not too straight and he doesn't have sex appeal and not enough charisma ,but this is the only space based series for normal people from the present,excepting Lost In Space and the upcoming Picard Series .I'm still waiting to see a NORMAL (sexy) chinese main character or a sexy blonde girl,but i think they don't exist in Star Wars universe.In my opinion the episodes with Prometheus from Stargate SG-1 were more SW like than everything made after the original trilogy.

Again with the muppets.
spammon-117 November 2019
I didn't sign up to watch 'Muppet Babies Live' on Star Wars. I get it. You own the Muppets. Even George Lucas put that crap behind him. What's next? Claymation? The reason they used those method is because we did not have the technology. Star Was is and always has been about using the best technology out there. Not about retro disco era throwbacks.

This is tripe and the story is even worse. Sorry I can't get past the Planet of the Apes thing. It's not an ugnaught. It's ... sorry I need to... I can't. I just can't. Why does Star Wars feel like its taking a step back? Even Star Trek blows away anything they've done. Now that's story telling. Has anyone seen the Trek shorts? How about Discovery? They did a major course correction in second half of season 1. It's got an overarching storyline. Good dialogue. Even great effects. Love it.

This looks like someone went on YouTube and made a DIY film.

So far disgusted. Blasphemy in Star Wars? And unnecessary gross cruelty.
temporary_email_address20 November 2019
There are no spoilers in the following text. I was really looking forward to this. It starts very promising. The sets, costumes, the whole vibe of the opening is very "vintage Star Wars." Remembering that Originally "Star Wars" is (was) a "space opera" Google the definition. <-- So not a political statement, nor a an exercise in all things PC, as was the absurd "The Last Jedi." So the Mandalorian starts great. But after about 5 minutes one of the characters blasphemes, not once but multiple times in a row.. BLASPHEMY ...in Star Wars.... Really? .... Seriously? Just why? I gritted my teeth and continued watching, hoping it would be a one off occurrence, as the character was not main. Then after another 10 minutes. (no spoilers) There is a vile, cruel, completely out of place, and unnecessary shot. (for a "Star Wars" title.) You see a close up of a Kowakian monkey-lizard. (The little creature that as in Jabba Palace.) Who in Star Wars canon, are not only sentient, but intelligent beings. On a spit being roasted over a fire.

Kathleen Kennedy, and her Rian Johnson, who made The aberation that is "the Last Jedi." Included a similar vile, and almost as disgusting thing as this in TLJ, with the sweet little porgs. (Who also have an intelligence.) And you would have thought that was vile enough. But even they tried to lessen that horrible scene as having the other Porgs cry for their friend, and Chewie, look contrite, and sorry. (But then TLJ was trash from start to finish.) You would think they would learn. rank cruelty has no place in SW.

But what makes the shot, in the Mandalorian, even worse. Both disturbing, and quite nauseating, is that about 3 feet away, (and the shot lingers on this.) There is another Kowakian monkey-lizard, in a tiny cage. Staring in fear and dread, at his friend / prior cage mate being cooked, and turned over the fire. Knowing he/shes next, grasping the bars, while mewling pitifully. Remembering that we the audience know these creatures are fully cognizant. Its just horrible.

Yes this is "fantasy," but its just the same as if it was a Jawa, an Ewok etc. We are watching a SCIFi show, immersing ourselves, and believing that all of these people, and creatures exist. There was no need for this "horror-esque" repugnant scene to have been in this type of program. Even more so, there is utterly NO NEED at all, and against canon for blasphemy to be in Star Wars.

Honestly, does every single program from Hollywood now have to have blasphemy, or horror, or gore, or be "woke" politically themed.

meh
decaturskid9 January 2020
The Mandalorian is the plain girl in a room full of piglets. She looks beautiful only because the bar has been set so low. In truth, it's not so bad compared to the rest of the garbage Disney has been pumping out. When I first saw the baby Yoda I thought those star squiggly ampersands are complete geniuses. There going to make a gozillion dollars on that. Then they didn't make one in time for Christmas so not so much genius as I thought. It really is just average. They haven't shoved a lot of PC garbage in it yet, but get a good grip on something solid for season 2. It's Disney and they've proven they can't keep their mouths shut. Not even for money. It's worth a watch.

ghanima_atrieadies14 December 2019
I wish the episodes were longer but this show is amazing. Writing, production, cast, everything. The people doing this show should do ALL the Star Wars movies. Pedro Pascal is a hell of an actor. To be able to convey emotions from behind a mask 100% of the time and without speaking is not easy but he does it so well. I love everything about this show and it's redeemed the travesty that is Force Awakens and the god awful Last Jedi.

Mandalorian is true Star Wars.

A very pleasant story
ersbel11 December 2019
A very pleasant story. Probably one of the best in the Star Wars universe. And it's impressive how they could integrate so many elements from A New Hope without making a rehash. And even the characters are quite good. Not as good as some of the better series of NetFlix, but very good compared with what mainstream TV still produces.

Sadly, they never polished the product and the special effects team is the best by far. The direction is okay, but with many cheap drama. For example in the 4th episode, probably the worst of the first four, the Mandalorian knows he's in a peaceful village, there is nothing threatening, yet he jumps when a kid sneaks in. Is he a bounty hunter or a domestic abuse victim?

The script is even worse than the direction once you stop going with the flow. I mean the guy has levitation devices, yet he can't have some perimeter sensor to know that many individuals are about to jump him? Smart droids and no smart phone app to tell you that somebody is robbing your ship and you might be stuck in the middle of nowhere?

And what's with all the deus ex machina? The hero is cornered, but here's the entire Eastern Front Army to the rescue! He might be eaten alive by a herbivore, but a farmer just happens to be near and saves him?

And the choreography is cute as long as you keep it shallow. But the guy has a fancy new armor that can take a cannon shot, yet he will get beaten like dressed in a flannel shirt. And the armor is magical, probably as negative weight, as thugs will keep throwing him as he's in his bathing suit.

Enter the populist junk: the village that lives in perfect harmony with themselves and with the nature. The clothes are industrially made, clean, too clean for some people working all day in the field. The population of the isolated village is Asian, after all Disney strives for diversity, but the actors are from all over Asia, not just one area, a bit too much genetic diversity. And the villagers are happy, although they are under constant threat from the robbers. And the robbers don't seem to do much over the year, but rob this village.

So, yea, a nice story, but don't think about it or it will prove just another Hollywood piece.

Love the show. But what's with the 30 minute episodes? Is it a sitcom?

Everything is perfect!!!
layna1@hotmail.com7 December 2019
YES!!! YES!!! YES!!!! Something came out great in Star wars! I was (like many) badly disappointed by the last couple Star wars. This Tv show made it all go away.

It's just perfect! Nothing too fancy, no superhero...Just a Bounty hunter is this magical universe.

Well, no spoilers here since it's everywhere on the web but baby "yoda" is just too cute. (IT'S NOT YODA...it's the same species).

If they keep the story like it is...It will be one of the best i've seen in a long time.

GOOD JOB DISNEY!

Star Wars Done Right!
dustin_nichols-311125 December 2019
Finally, a SW show from Disney that makes the watcher feel as amazed as the original trilogy. The storyline, acting, writing & production are spot on! The Mandalorian brings new life to the SW franchise. Hopefully, this series marks a crucial turning point towards a robust for SW & SW fans.

Judging by the reviews this is going to have people crash Disney plus for awhile
justin-fencsak12 November 2019
I've listened to the soundtrack for Chapter 1 of the show without looking at the song names and so far it's good...i cannot wait until i see the show when its on bluray disc...i saw the footage during halftime of the football game last night and it looks like a real live action star wars show aimed at teens. It's not like r rated, as Disney plus content is aimed at families while hulu caters to adults and espn plus caters to sports fans. A bundle is already out for those who want it all.

Something a Star Wars Fan can appreciate
nacomas12 November 2019
The Mandalorian is off to a great start. The show is captures you from the beginning, the flash back scene when the Mandalorian was reminiscing from his past childhood, only give hopes that the back story will be revealed. The whole production from theme, sound, costume designs, cinematography and speaking alien language, especially "Huttese" is the right ingredients for this series to be something worthwhile and special...

Was not expecting THAT
JeanDeMichaque4 February 2020
I can't believe how good this series is, especially compared to the sequel trilogy or even episode 1,2,3

This series is Star Wars!

A-m-a-z-i-n-g cinematography, splendid acting, awesome dystopian atmosphere, very good pacing, convincing CGI and, oh my God, the outstanding soundtrack ( every outro is a piece of art, the music divine). Everything in this show is - almost - perfection. Plus, you get to enjoy a unbelievably cute and witty Baby Yoda. What more can one wish?

My rating is 9 out of 10 because I would like more elaborated stories which span for many episodes. Every episode has a different story, and each of them build up the bigger story of the Mandalorian. They could work a bit on this. Other than that, congratulations Disney. This is how you do it. I have spoken :P

Star Wars has been known for its intense Lightsaber duels, and great battles of good vs evil, so it is nice to see a different type of story in the immense universe that is Star Wars. The action is superb, and the storytelling is simple yet effective.

DO NOT DESPAIR , STAR WARS ISN'T DEAD YET, THERE'S STILL HOPE!!!!
degryse-4410131 January 2020
And everything that's wrong with the last 2 Star Wars movies... is totally right with this series!!! :-D

Seriously, if they can make a series like this, then what are they doing totally ruining those films? :-S

This series actually has a decent plot and takes the time for story and character development!! The action is most definitely there, but it's not pointless and there are actual quiet and emotional moments as well.

I'd definitely recommend this series to anybody, so just forget about that last film trilogy and watch The Mandalorian with an open mind, cause you won't be disappointed! ;-)

This Is The Way....... Fantasic First Season
dormesher-2156519 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
The Mandalorian season 1. This is one awesome show in the Star Wars universe and definitely one the best things Disney have come out with sinse taking over from Lucasfilm.

Din Djarin is one of the best characters introduced into Star Wars in this new Era he is such a bad ass and you meet some other great characters along the way in this show like The Kid (Baby Yoda) and Cara Dune who used to be a shock trooper.

This show is amazing and has some awesome moments and new different story each week that only latest 30 minutes and it was a really fantastic set up for this series.

The effects are amazing and for TV it definitely has a scale to it that feels like your watching a movie its incredible to watch. And seeing The Mandalorian care more for this creature and grow more through out the show is amazing to watch.

Din Djarins backstory is also really interesting he is a foundling that was found by the Mandalorians during the Clone Wars and has been raised by them ever sinse and the show slowly introduces his backstory bit by bit which keeps you interested.

My Favourite episodes are definitely the season finales they were such a fantastic finale to the first season Baby Yoda is powerful and loved seeing Death Watch in live action. Mando now has his own Clan and where the hell did Gideon get that Dark Saber it's a fantastic cliffhanger for season 1.

The only thing that annoys me is it leaves something open it teases a possible character returning early on the season in the episode Gunslinger there's a person who walks up to Fennec Shand and we still don't know who it is and I really hope the fans are right and it's Boba Fett returning wish we would of found who it was.

Verdict 9.7/10 a brillaint show and a fantastic first season to the Mandalorian and some brillant characters introduced to the universe like Din Djarin and Cara Dune. Ends on fantasic cliffhanger and now I can't wait for season 2.

First Live Action Star Wars TV Show
caleb-hawn16 January 2020
I personally really enjoyed the Mandalorian! Being the first ever Star Wars live action TV show, I was really impressed with what they did. It was very different from a normal Star Wars work, however. There was no opening crawl, and even the music was very different from the traditional Star Wars style. The show is very independent. It could have been just as easily not been part of Star Wars. It just happened to have Star Wars aliens and a Star Wars setting. I think the music was really good, even if it doesn't hold the iconic Star Wars style. The characters are interesting to follow, even if we don't know their names throughout most of it (other than the memed Baby Yoda, which isn't actually his name since it's obviously not even Yoda). The only problem I had with it was shown in the first episode: the bounty hunter trackers. It makes no realistic sense that a bounty hunter is just given a little hot/cold device to tell exactly where an acquisition is located at all times. But I guess it saves the audience from sitting through the months of tracking that bounty hunters realistically have to perform before getting to the actual action. That's why they're called bounty hunters and not bounty catchers. Despite the unrealistic bounty hunting, I really enjoyed the show, and I hope they make more seasons and more shows like this in the future. Thanks for reading my review of Star Wars: The Mandalorian: season 1!

Good, but not great
rbrow-3335313 January 2020
The first episode was really good. It made you feel like the Mandalorian was going to be some badass warrior that everyone fears and that the story was going to be awesome. From then on until the last episode, it wasn't as fun, and almost hard to watch at times because of the horrible acting on the part of the supporting characters. After the first episode, you see Mando as a clumsy grunt who can't win a fight by himself and only survives because of his armor. That was probably the most disappointing part of the series for me. I would have like for him to be more formidable as a warrior.

Worth the watch, but I really hope they improve on season 2 and invest in some better supporting actors/actresses.

Maybe the best Star Wars
chrislawuk8 January 2020
I felt that The Mandalorian was a mature version of Star Wars and filled the void for that audience wanting to recapture what they experienced as Kids with the original Star Wars trilogy. Its vastly superior to alot of the films. The first episode is still my favourite with an excellent scene involving a battle droid. Its an excellent side franchise with The Mandalorian being a superb character to focus on

Engaging! Exciting! Emotional! This is how you do it! This is the way!
ozracampbell4 January 2020
The last few movies... second thought: forget about that!

This draws me in! I love it! It feels real, genuine, relatable -- all solidly marinated in the Star Wars atmosphere, with spices of Predator and Terminator tickling your adventure palate!

If Disney could be reasonable enough to accept simply making loads of money and a world of fans -- and simple quality entertainment lovers like me -- cry with gratitude (how can anyone not want such a win-win!?) -- they should simply leave full control of the entire franchise to the guys behind this! They understand entertainment!

This is the way!

What Every Star Wars Movie Wishes it Was
jmihalchik-670312 January 2020
For my fellow Gen Xer's, the Star Wars Trilogy was an essential part of childhood. After years of rewatching them as an adult, my personal consensus is that they were actually, well, really, really corny. Just plain old bad, in fact. But the galaxy corrects itself with The Mandolorian. After 40 years of bad dialogue, some questionable characters (did those primitive dwarf bears really bring down the Galactic Empire?), and three horrific prequels we have a story with meat The Mandolorian himself is dull beyond tears. But his universe is full of believable characters with realistic stories that you can appreciate. Little Yoda makes any previous plush toy look like Jabba the Hutt. But the writers don't fall into the Lucas trap of using him ad nauseum. Well balanced with good pace- even if the lead character makes Boba Fett seem like a bounty hunter with OCD.

cuzcatleco-369071 January 2020
The Mandalorian is an amazing show. The main character "Mando" is someone that we root for and the introduction of baby yoda elevated the show even further. The special effects are also amazing for something on the silver screen. And the finale of the 1st season will leave the audience wanting for more.

100 times better than the Disney star wars movies.
leeangus-0935828 December 2019
After a average first episode the series really picked up and had a strong finish. Was it better than pre disney star wars movies, animations? well not in my opinion. Was it better than the Disney star wars movies, well yes a lot better. So pretty enjoyable, just don't let the writers of the last star wars trilogy touch the mandalorian and it will be good in series 2 also.

Hope is back
superruser-lr28 December 2019
As I mentioned in my review of the first episode, the story wants to be simplistic and easy to follow, and that's the case here. But I have to give a massive thanks to the team of screenwriters, directors and producers to NOT follow the same story architecture as the Star Wars movies. Compared to the somewhat unstructured plot of the postlogy, I feel that they know how the story will go in the coming seasons and that's a good thing. It was made from good intentions: the fact that they were inspired by Seven Samurai and the western-spaghetti genre helps The Mandalorian to differentiate from other Star Wars productions; it has his own identity. However, some episodes are repetitive and/or not trying to go that far, especially the episode 5, which is the worst of the season: it brings nothing to the story and the characters. But in general, the plot for this season is good.

The good ideas continue for the characters, especially The Mandalorian, which is simply the best character of the Disney/Star Wars-era. His evolution through the episodes are interesting, I was invested by it. You know, as the viewer, that there is a human under his armor: it has emotions, he made mistakes like us, he likes and hates things... I mean, the least and easiest thing to do with this kind of character is to give him a certain depth, and they did it. This is not the first time though, George Lucas already did it in Attack of the Clones, but I felt that it was not as interesting as The Mandalorian, even though it's was one of the most interesting things to see in Star Wars Episode 2 (by far). This human approach to the character is helped by the physical and vocal acting of Pedro Pascal. When he talks, we have a certain idea of what are his feelings. This is not an easy way to do acting, but Pedro Pascal is more than convincing in his character. The supporting roles are good addition to the lead throughout the episodes: Werner Herzog, Nick Nolte, Carl Weathers, the comedic presence of Taika Waititi, Gina Carano (she's very good actress) and Giancarlo "Gus Fring" Esposito... you were all good (except Jake Cannavale).

The directing, as a whole, was pretty good, not great. I like the way they played the focus of the camera to concentrate uniquely on the characters. The episodes directed by Dave Filoni were basically the least interesting to see technically. Bryce Dallas Howard did a pretty good job in the episode 4; not the greatest episode of the show, but we have some emotional depth. Deborah Chow and Rick Famuyiwa directed to good parts of The Mandalorian, and surprisingly, the last episode was well directed by Waititi, he can mix the tones between action, comedy and drama with ease. I found that the image merits to be a bit dirtier, considering the tone; I found it a bit too clean. Cinematography is good, the color palette pleasant to the eye at moments. No need to talk about VFX here, there were very good generally.

I have to give some credits to Ludwig Göransson for composing a different kind of music for a Star Wars, another voice from the symphony scores that gave us John Williams, Michael Giacchino or John Powell. The story needed to be accompanied by Ludwig Göransson's sure-handed mix of electronic and symphonic original score. The main theme is memorable, the little touch of 808 bass and hit-hats from the trap music is a funny and enjoyable addition, not surprising though from the guy that composed the music for Black Panther (I was even asking myself when the compositor would add that rap instruments in the show). The original score itself is a reason to see The Mandalorian.

I had to be honest with you: I wasn't expecting too much from the show, when I saw the pilot. Objectively, The Mandalorian is good overall, the acting is good, the characters are very interesting, but the story lacks something deeper in my opinion, with the episode 5 in mind. But subjectively, you have to see the effort made from the team for offering us a good Star Wars story, with great ideas and inspirations, an identity to the show that it is unique to the franchise. The last episode gives some indications that the season 2 will be even better with greater stakes. The original score is one of the best I've heard this year (in a film or a show), I love the characters, the tone, the visuals, the mythology behind the bounty hunters. This is Star Wars the fans wanted to see in years. Hope is definitely back.

The Mandalorian Season 1's rating: 7.3/10.

Great Show
sollyharv27 December 2019
Except for episode 6 (Sorry Billy-boy) it's all really good! I'm not a huge Star Wars guy, so some of the world building stuff is gibberish to me, but it's already done a lot more to suck me into the universe than any of the films from the series that I've seen (might have to give some of them a rewatch after this, though). Anyway; the action's good, as are the practical and visual effects, the characters are interesting and the baby is adorable!

With favreau in full control, Disney scores with this series. After basically setting up the mcu, I think its time for favreau to just stay behind the camera. Brilliant writing and great directors, this show is fantastic. You don't even need to know much about S.W to enjoy the show. 9/10 reccomend

I like all episodes but I feel are similar. At the moment I can't see a continuing story, are different fights with different bad guys in different places. I hope the story grows because the entire series the Mandalorian protecting the child and escaping the empire would become boring.

I'm not a person with huge understanding of what is considered good or bad cinematography these days, nor am i film critic but i am a bit of a geek who loves entertaining science fiction shows and appreciate Star Wars and Star Trek equally. I loved The Orville mainly because it had that "classic" feel to it and i really loved first few episodes of The Mandalorian for same reason. It have this "classic" feel to it that makes these series really special and enjoyable

A Grittier, Realistic Take on Star Wars!
henryshear30 November 2019
This show, quite literally, is the definition of Star Wars. There are creatures and easter eggs in every episode that refer to the movies as well as other tv shows set in the Star Wars universe. Jon Favreau has done an amazing job recreating the architecture of buildings reminiscent of the movies and slowly crafting heart that the Star Wars universe is known for.

That being said, the show is not perfect. The show has filler scenes and episodes where the plot is not advanced. The plot does begin to pick up speed, but the show does tend to drag and go through tried and true storylines that are far too predictable. Another side note, the music to the show is truly terrible. John Williams is definitely needed in this regard.

The storylines may be predictable, but the show is not devoid of twists. There are surprises throughout the episodes that are very amusing and great for the plot. I will not dive into spoilers here, but one of the twists later provides a great amount of humor and are some of the best moments of levity that the show has to offer.

The comedy is not plentiful because Pedro Pascal, aka Mando, does not have a sense of humor. Pascal plays Mando very, very well especially because he never takes his mask off. Somehow, he is able to display emotion and his feelings with only his words in a masterful performance. Not only that, but if you are a Star Wars fan, much is learned about Mandalorian mythology.

All in all, the show did not meet my expectations upon release, but I am now starting to enjoy and like it. Star Wars is an amazing universe and I cannot wait to see what stories will be told next. I definitely suggest that Star Wars fans everywhere need to watch this show!!!

The Potential Is Great...
frankie14262230 November 2019
I'm not a Star Wars Genius. When I was a child I loved the original trilogy. As an adult looking back the acting was awful, with the exception of Harrison Ford. That really didn't change in the newer movies. In fact, they just got worse (with the exception of Rogue One). Rogue One was excellent.

The Mandalorian in my opinion has a great story and the potential is endless. Its already better than the recent movies not named Rogue One. To nip pick a bit, it's not even 30 minutes when you count the beginning and ending credits. I don't know if Pedro Pascal is actually in that uniform, but whoever it is (probably just a stuntman) looks very uncomfortable moving around. He's very slow in every movement. If you watch, he's extremely careful with steps. It's really my biggest complaint. Ironman looks more comfortable in fight scenes than this guy. I'm being funny with that last statement, but it's too highlight my point. Clearly this character has to be Proficient and deadly with hand to hand combat, grappling, martial-arts. How can he if he's scared stiff to just walk down a flight of steps. Maybe he can't see out of the helmet. Lastly, my guess is it's a stuntman and all Pedro is doing is voiceovers. Easy money.

Ark775430 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Disney and live action star wars has not fared well

(Besides rogue one, that was a brilliant film)

The new trilogy is let's be real...stupid. I have little hope episode 9 will be of any great ending and I hope somehow they leave it alone and if they ever venture into the Skywalker line again they do not do it in film form..

The mandalorian is simply how you do star wars..and by people who know what story they want to tell and make it interesting.

Let's be honest no-one saw yoda coming and it's such an amazing thing to have, I do not doubt either this storyline will somehow carry on in some regard to the timeline of episode 9 to start a new story after that craps done with.

Love this series.

May the Force of Episode IV be with You

"The Mandalorian" calls the spirit of the original Star Wars to its aid. It's not perfect, but it comes closer to the original feeling of Star Wars

If you were a fan of "A New Hope" and "The Empire Strikes Back", you will like this television series. And by the way, the production value, acting, and cinematography is first rate (HBO level budget and quality.)

P.S. The third episode was very good. Each episode is trending the right way.

Take Notes Disney
drewster1-693-78585924 November 2019
This is Star Wars! Even with as short as these episodes are, they still carry more energy than the most recent films of the Skywalker series. Keep up the great work Favreau and Filoni!

Do more of "this" , Star Wars people
work-azb24 November 2019
While, it's obvious the production value can be improved and writing can get refined, this is what Star Wars really should feel like. Disney ought to realize that SW has a giant extended universe that can be tapped into and if done in a similar to Mandalorian gritty manner, they will have made new fans and brought back the fans who left. I don't know if Kathleen Kennedy had anything to do with Mandalorian, but the team behind it solid. Solid! Make more great stories that push our imagination. Stories that simply test the resolve of good versus evil. Leave quasi political negativity out. For the love of God; don't turn SW to the dark side.

Finally some real Star Wars
wolfm@hol.gr24 November 2019
The people behind this show are real star wars fans who know what they are doing. The Result? This show is a great success and loved by everyone from casual fans to star wars fanatics. Disney should think long and hard on why it didn't follow the same recipe with the trilogy and allowed people who don't love star wars to sit in the director's chair of a Star Wars movie.

Episode 3 "American Graffiti" reference
chanceshoults23 November 2019
Am I the only person who noticed the "American Graffiti" reference in the 3rd episode. There's no possible way it's a coincidence. Lucas wrote and directed it "American Graffiti" and created the Star Wars universe.

Oh my god, I was close to believe that the true Start Wars spirit is gone forever. But now this. As many reviewer before, I can only say this is it, this is Star Wars. John Favreau understands the magical formula, what it's really all about, that special feeling. And so he packs a story that contains everything it takes to cheer. And at every end of an episode, you think "Oh no, is it really over?" Fantastic.

Listen to an ORIGINAL fan
longshot_x7421 November 2019
The first thing that gave me hope for this when it was announced was the name John Favreau. He's and old school fan and understands. I held my breath for this series after the atrocities of VII and VIII, the cancelled spin-off movies, and J.J. being back in charge to give us a rehashed, reboot, slap-in-the-face to true fans again with IX. To those that say this series is bland or slow - wait- it's not a single movie, it has an entire season to go. It's going to build - at least that's what I'm getting so far. More will be revealed as it goes like any good series. You don't need the whole first episodes to be exposition. You have to have some wonder. I do agree that the episodes are a little short and could be longer. For those commenting on the helmet being a barrier to the actor so far as emotion, etc. You don't give Pedro and the director enough credit and you are not a study of tone and body language. The emotional performance comes through the mask by way of subtle tones in voice and body language. A brief pause, a deep breath, the way a weapon is carried or holstered tells a lot. I don't agree with everyone saying Disney did it. The only thing Disney as a whole did right was sign Favreau to it and let the right creative team run with it. I do agree with those that wish he (Favreau) could be put in charge of the movies. I am one of those fans who had the first trilogy memorized in grade school. I also did not cry and moan over the prequels even though they had some issues at least they weren't the train wreck of the sequels that makes it clear that the writers had NO understanding of the Star Wars universe or astrophysics for that matter (yes, I'm talking about the ludicrous space chase in VIII). I will say though, being a Boba Fett fan since 1980, I would like maybe for John to somehow work in (maybe in the finale) a reveal that Boba Fett escaped the Sarlaac pit and possibly have an appearance. I'm sure they could do it in a way to wrap up his arc and not take away from the current Mandalorian's story. I only give this an 8 out of 10 as of episode 2 but if it continues the way its going it might earn a 9 or 10. Take note Disney and MARVEL specifically. THIS is how you do a series (except for length) and THIS is an example of what you should do with the Wolverine character now.

The Joys of Star Wars Re-Imagined!
natta2819 November 2019
I have now watched the first two episodes and I can honestly say, I've loved every minute of this so far.

I got the same joy I got from watching the first Star Wars films, you can immediately feel the massive magnitude of the Star Wars universe. The characters, scenery, buildings, sounds all feel like Star Wars. Add to that an engaging storyline, so far detached from the original that it feels brand new and completely familiar at the same time. This has far outweighed my expectations so far and believe it will continue to do so.

The very best from the Star Wars universe in a looong time.
jimaahansen18 November 2019
Just watched the second episode and the series keep on impressing me. This TV series is what I have missed since the originale Star wars movies(4,5,6). You get the feeling of that univers again with George Lucas' touch. There is even a scene that reminds me of Harrelson Fords reckless roles(in a different George Lucas movie). Do not know how they did it, but the creator of this series has produced a story that has more touch to the original star wars univers than ANY of the prolog or epilog movies. You finally feel that wonderous, quirky, mythical, untamed univers, that George Lucas created. This Mandalorion (with constant helmet on) brings more character, than 1-3&7-9(yes even with whatever 9 brings) has brought. Keep up the extraordinary work. I can not stop praising this series.

short but action packed
chrisdye-4220717 November 2019
Okay though i must say this is short lived' just over 30 minutes' there is so much going on here theres action adventure to the core heart and even brief humor the story moves right along and never really gets dull the characters are get to knowable and fun my only caution is to parents of sensitive kids as this is pretty much a constant warzone except for some calm parts

This is Star Wars!!!!
selaromyar17 November 2019
This is what the features need. . . This visionary tale were you care for the characters which harkens back to when the audience was emotionally involved and connected with its characters, like with Luke. One can notice that it is a simple tale, and is one hell of an adventure, and most importantly, it is fun. This is Star Wars, simple plot, great adventure, and special effects are to help to plot along, and not BE the plot and story. Disney+ has knocked out of the park with this one.

I will never watch Star War the same again!!!
rebornblr17 November 2019
What we fail to forget is that the "Mandolorian" is not Babo Fett which I think a lot of people assume his name is Din Jarron. Baba fett is actually not Mandolorian but a clone of jango fett but grew up as something different. Anyway the show is AMAZING it is movie quality and BEAUTIFUL! My my Disney hit a home run with this show. It gripped me from minute one, and the make up and costumes is second to none! My new favorite show! I know that jist from watching 2 episodes, it's that good! If you dont love this you should be ashamed of yourself. J/K.

sam-3256916 November 2019
An outstanding musical score, great effects, Star Wars themes, and a reasonable level intrigue already makes this a winner for me. A bit hard to judge the acting at this point, as the abundance of action with bots and creatures doesn't leave a lot of room for meaningful dialogues. Certainly nothing about the acting or script is disagreeable so far, but time will tell. I look forward to the rest of the season, and may raise my rating later if it pans out.

doctordbx16 November 2019
If you don't get hung up on what is Star Wars and what you think it should be and just take it for what it is this is a very entertaining show.

If you approach this with unreachable expectations then you are setting yourself up for disappointment and only have yourself to blame.

Well written. Well acted. Some nice humour. Good effects. It just comes together and works... If you let it.

I have been a huge Star Wars, and Spaghetti Western fan my whole life, this show is exactly what I have been waiting for. Perfect blend of bad a** fight scenes, and so far an interesting and cool story. I would definitely recommend The Mandalorian to anyone who likes Star Wars, any Western, or samurai movies. This show is in good hands (not JJ, or Rian)

This is great, it has the right feel of a Star Wars movie, but in TV format.

Depending on how strong the story is as it unfolds this could potentially be one of Star Wars' best, however, we'll wait and see. Been burnt before.

This first episode was really astounding, the cinematography and the special effects are on par with the film franchise. Jon Favreau really knows what he is doing with this TV series and the fans will very likely be overjoyed by this TV debut. The work speaks for itself.

The action is great , especially the last ten minutes which will make you beg for the next episode.

What A New Start
sonickav12 November 2019
The Star Wars Franchise has seen some up and downs with all their content from movies, to comics to well everything. Other than the true feeling you get from the animal movements to the atmosphere in the cantina's this is Star Wars. And honestly the more you know about Legends and new cannon the better this show is. Its beautifully done with what already looks like a great cast of actors. Its awesome to finally see Disney put out not only a Quality piece but a well written and lore friendly tv show (not just because its making new lore)

For those who know anything in the Legends (or EU) about Mandalorians I have a good feeling are going to LOVE this show as it continues to come out if the first episode is any sign so please enjoy! (PS. I hold loremaster credentials on Wookiepidia)

EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!
ryan-42315-2857212 November 2019
I've never been more excited for a show to come out, and I was slightly worried that The Mandalorian would not be able to live up to my expectations (only because they were so high). But I was wrong! The first episode was everything I imagined it could be and more. The cinematography was beautiful, the scenery and its inhabitants were breathtaking, and the story is intriguing. It feels like Star Wars, but Star Wars as we've never seen it before, and I love it. The score was the one big difference from traditional Star Wars, but it was honestly one of my favorite parts of the episode and one of the best scores for a show that I've ever heard. Even the end credits are beautiful. The first episode was simply incredible and I can't wait to see more!

(And that ending! I had to watch it more than once. Wow!)

jlandree-355-84159912 November 2019
With the current array of Star Wars from Disney on parade, the Mandalorian breaks ranks and sets its own standard. This has great potential to align with the success of Rogue One.

It is possible that Disney breaks the curse of bad storytelling when it comes to Star Wars. Only time will tell.

An Honest Review
generationofswine14 November 2019
Well, so far I have only seen the pilot... and I'm still kind of convinced that they will ruin it but, for the moment, it is fantastic with the only real draw back being the score and some of the sets.

Well cover the bad first. The score is horrible. In no way does it sound like a Star Wars movie. But that can be fixed.

And the second is the sets, three different bars, three different worlds, the exact same place. I understand it's a cost cutting thing, but change it up a bit.

Now the good.

They dropped the agenda. It's still there, a little, but the agenda doesn't dominate the plot. It's not made to drive a wedge between the fans, and the political shriekers. It's not made to let people point their fingers and shriek "Misogynist, WWII bad guy word, Boomer, Russianbot," at anyone that doesn't like it. It's not weighted to do anything BUT tell a story.

And the result is that it actually tells a fun story.

Now the story is simplistic, but it's a pilot, and no one ever said that they wanted a complex, convoluted, Oliver Stone plot, they just said they wanted an actual story.

So the plot can be simplistic as all get out and still entertain. And it does.

The other positive is that it FINALLY feels like an actual Star Wars story again. They aren't attempting to "divert expectations" by making a Star Wars flick that is not a Star Wars flick... they actually made a Star Wars flick.

It feels like Star Wars again. And that is fun, it has all of the appeal of a Star Wars flick, and it has very little of the baggage that came with the Kennedy films.

Ultimately, it's a fun series, it's a Star Wars show, it actually feels like it's about Star Wars and not about dividing the fan base.

The missing link in the Post-Empire Story. More "human", with a place to go from there.
PowerSheetAI13 November 2019
The premier was everything I'd hoped for in what is finally a live-action Star Wars series. A bit of humor, without overdoing it. The anti-hero was a bit more "human" (though yes, I know, not actually one) and fallible than expected - but then again, no one comes close to Boba Fett. However, that does make for a more realistic story, and leaves it with someplace to go. The chance to learn more about the Mandalorian armor is a nice touch. I'm happy to see this is in a post-imperial setting, vs. yet another prequel. I just wish the premiere was longer. I can't wait for the next episode!

Hey kids, do you love Star Wars? Do you love spaghetti westerns? Then you're going to LOVE the Mandalorian!

People who grew up with Star Wars, and newcomers alike, gather at the table that is Disney +. for Disney has prepped a delicious meal that you all can enjoy.

Disney's best Star Wars effort, right next to Rogue One. It FEELS like Star Wars, it looks like Star Wars, it sounds like Star Wars, it is Star Wars, and it is a series! Acting is great, writing is great (so far), production value is excellent, and the sound and score are just wonderful! Its only been an episode at the time of writing this, but I believe John Favreau and Dave Filoni have something golden written up! Go watch it! Rinse the wretched taste of Last Jedi free of your mouth!

SHAME ON YOU FAVREAU & SHAME ON DISNEY $100,000,000. For this garbage.
gareth-7544216 November 2019
"The travails of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic." Really!! Please its 2019 & the best Disney can come up with is 8 episodes of really poor cowboy sci-fi & at a cost of $100,000,000, I mean I'm a fan of Jon Favreau but this is insane, don't get me wrong everything is there to make this a brilliant show except ( just like the recent movies) decent writing & someone that really wants to make a decent star wars show. I don't care enough about the "star wars" franchise to be bothered by its untimely demise but my youngest son & my grandson do. Episode IV a new hope was the only true attempt to tell a star wars story, everything after that has been about nothing more than merchandising & making as much money as possible so once Disney acquired it from George lucas for several billion they are desperate to claw those billions back + more hence garbage movies with no substance or heart & now a garbage TV series all to rope in the morons spending their hard earned cash on garbage merchandise. That aside I do have a real problem with this show & in particular with episode 2 where the mandolorian faces off against a rhino like creature, now let's put this in perspective for all you morons that are leaving 9s & 10s for this garbage, the creature is made up it's a prop for the story line but keep in mind that right from "Episode 6 the empire strikes back" the fans of star wars has gotten younger & younger, the company execs know this, Disney know this & Jon Favreau knows this, kids are the biggest money spinner going, so who the hell was the sicko that green lighted a scene where a female creature protecting the egg of its unborn was to be slaughtered for no reason other than so a bunch of jawas could crack it open & eat it like a cream egg, the creature was a threat to no one, it had not been a threat to any one or anything, with all that's gone on in this world with the mindless hunting & slaughter of animal species this scene was sickening , shame on you Favreau & shame on Disney for this garbage, I won't recommend this to anyone & I certainly won't be letting my grandson watch this. THINK ABOUT THE MESSAGE YOU'RE SENDING OUT TO THE YOUNGER AUDIENCE. A final note to all the reviewers that are falling over each other to gush about this show, if you want Disney to do decent star wars themed movies & TV shows then give honest reviews & they might listen but continously over rate garbage & you'll get more garbage, demand they do something that's worthy of your time & money, otherwise you'll see this franchise die a death long before it should

Wrongfully riding on the Starwars saga
pietclausen14 January 2020
Most boring start to this new program, very slowly getting some direction and speed to make it passable to watch.

Making the short episodes is also wasting viewing time with introductory titles and end credits. Not pleasant to watch in this format.

Overall it's worth a 4 and no more. Hope is will urge the producers to make a proper length second season. Episode 8 did set this straight.

Brings back the KotOR vibe
Jesper28016 January 2020
Watching the Mandalorian brings back many memories from the way too many hours I spent playing Knights of the Old Republic. It has beautiful cinematography, it's well-written (!), and it has interesting characters played by excellent actors.

We follow the mandolarian bounty hunter Manda, who is scrapping his way through petty jobs to get steel for new armor - a sign of great status within the Mandolorian creed. One day, he is hired by Greef Karga played Carl Weathers (Dillon from the original Predator) to go on an off-the-books mission that puts him in a moral dilemma that challenges his very creed on which his entire existence is built. His decision sets him on a captivating adventure building up to a breath taking finale. Actor performances by Nick Nolte, Giancarlo Esposito (Gus from Breaking Bad) and not the least Pedro Pascal make it an absolute pleasure to follow Manda and his companion on their many quests. I can't wait for season 2!

The Mandalorian is quite fun and engaging to watch. It boasts impressive cinematography, music and CGI. However, what gets me is the subpar action sequence. They desperately need a better action coordinator and improved action plots. The current action sequence is almost children movie level, with enemies going out of their way to make it inevitable for the protagonist to win. Please spend some money on this crucial stage of the production. The Mandalorian is supposed to be among the best fighters in the galaxy. You need to do a much better job to convince the viewers of that.

Series...Has Everything
kvnnagel30 December 2019
A former protagonist turned hero, history, friendships. Disney Toned down the obvious Rhetoric A bit.. and BABY YODA.. everything about the character development has been PERFECT. Favreau keep it up. We'll keep watching . The Star Wars Faithful have noticed.

A Great Debut For Live -Action Star Wars On The Small Screen
KalKenobi8328 December 2019
Watched The Mandalorian the Series which Stars Pedro Pascal(Game Of Thrones) as Djn Djarin Aka Mando, Gina Carano(Deadpool) as Cara Dune. Taika Watiti(Thor Ragnarok) as IG-11, Nick Nolte(Warrior) as Kuill , Emilly Swallow(Supernatural) as The Armorer, Carl Weathers(Rocky, Predator) as Greef Carga, Clancy Brown(Starship Troopers) as Burg, Natalia Tena(Harry Potter) As X'ian, Bill Burr(Date Night)as Mayfield, Mark Boone Junior (Batman Begins) as Ran, Richard Ayoade(Submarine) as Zero, Julia Jones(Wind River) as Omera, Ming Na-Wen(Push, Mulan) as Fennec Shand also Starring Werner Herzog(Jack Reacher) as The Client, and Giancarlo Esposito(Breaking Bad) as Moff Gideon The Series Villain.

The series is amazing each episode was awesome also the series had a great guest director for the most part also incredible performances by Pedro Pascal who channeled Eastwood also the Baby Yoda has become a Global Phenomenon also Gina Carano did amazing as Cara Dune this role suits her and she has acted her best since retiring from UFC and Taika Waititi was Brilliant as IG-11 he was no Korg so you can distinguish the too also Nick Nolte and Emily Swallow did great as Mentors in Kuilll and The Armorer to The Mando both were great this definitely rivals Doctor Who, Game Of Thrones Earlier seasons and Stranger Things and is the reason why you should get Disney+ The Bar has been set for Both The Kenobi, Cassian and Possibly Doctor Aphra shows all 3 which I think will be unique and different from The Mandalorian also this should keep our appetites sated as we wait in betweeen Post-Skywalker Films.

Great Score By Ludwig Gorrasson(Creed, Black Panther), Amazing Showrunning by Dave Filoni(Star Wars: Rebels), Jon Favreau(Iron Man) and Kathleen Kennedy(Jurassic Park) A Great Debut For Live -Action On The Small Screen 10/10

Brilliantly reignites the dead flame that was star wars!
lorenzoestevez28 December 2019
Mandalorian brilliantly takes Star Wars back from the terrible prequels and sequels - to give the star wars franchise a new life in serial episodes ... The original first episode of Star Wars (a new hope!) took the laser blasters of Flash Gordon serials and put them in the low-slung holsters of gunslingers, infamous space cowboys who do black market business in dusty off world colonies, while the draconian Empire tries to hold power with the power of the dark side of the Force. Those elements were what was so cool about the first episode of the original trilogy - Empire and Return of the Jedi then expanded the 'scifi western' themes into more of a collage of swashbuckling, fairy tales, WW2 explosive battles and aerial dogfights, along with that Casablanca styled espionage and romance - but the space gunslinger theme was always there. The Mandalorian superbly focuses on the scifi western themes more clearly, in short sharp stories which - like the old serials work excellently in keeping you wanting more... Where the sequels failed was packing so much into the films that they lost there 'stylised star wars theme' and became just another silly scifi like The Fifth Element and Valerian ...

Best show of 2019. Keeps you on edge the entire time. Side stories are quick and never drag you too far from the main story line.

Baby yoda was a shocker! Out of nowhere we've got some really interesting things happening in this show. Can't wait for season 2!

For you and your girlfriend!
henriquelrf19 December 2019
Ok, you saw from episode I to episode VI, and you ended up there, no problem! This series starts 5 years after episode VI and 25 years before episode VII, the best thing is that if your girlfriend has never seen a Star Wars movie, no problem! The series takes place inside the world of Star Wars, but does not follow the history of the Skywalkers!

If you're a big fan but didn't like the new episodes that much, this series is great for you because it absorbs more of the past!

I haven't enjoyed a Star Wars production this much in years. Love the format, the production values are excellent, and releasing the episodes once a week is a fantastic idea. I like that anticipation. It actually has a plot, character development and dialogue. Even some humor. So happy!

Can not wait to see the next chapter unfold.
orr-5439318 December 2019
Each week is like reading a well written chapter of your favorite book. It is Sad that Disney only made 8, 35 minutes episodes into season one. It is a good show so let get season 2 ramped up and released in the next 6 months. 8 half hour shows do not make a season but rather a mini series. Also I can not believe CBS spent 260 Million making 2 seasons of Star Trek: Discovery which was mostly unwatchable trash. I am sure Disney did not spend near that to product this great Star Wars TV show.

Finally a star wars story worth watching
kepi-5070515 December 2019
Being a big star wars fan myself, rly glad to see a star wars story that is worth watching unlike the other new movies/series (rebels, ep. 8 etc.) while watching Episode 8 was feeling like I'm being beaten up or betrayed it was so awful so was having troubles watching anything sw related.

They finally changed this with this series I'm looking forward to every episode the series has just such a good vibe and interesting story no craps like rebels or new episodes (the other new ones had mostly force related issues)

Definitely worth to watch if you're star wars fan and you think the other new movies and series don't make up for star wars.

Star Wars it is?
anderdob14 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Lots of people here say THIS IS STAR WARS. Well, is it? I'm 40 now and was grown watching Episodes IV-VI at least 50 times each and to be honest there is little to the original trilogy. Mandalorian does not feel like an adventure, it doesn't have that mood. It lacks the magic. It's more like Rouge 1. The story takes place in Star Wars world but something is missing. I know there are die-hard fans familiar with all not so popular Star Wars productions. I'm sure they can feel the vibe but people who are expecting big screen Star Wars in a TV show format may be and will be disappointed. Baby Yoda is sweet. Special effects are top notch. But it's so slow, so dark and Star Wars saga is pure fun! Even The Last Jedi is more enjoyable than Mandalorian in my opinion. It's good on it's own terms but could have been better. Maybe season 2 will give us some real SW nostalgia.

I've been a big Star Wars fan since the first movie. Not sure how this has 9/10 stars on IMDB. After watching 6 episodes it is 7/10 at best. Writing and acting could be better. Like the concept a lot and hope it will improve soon. Show has potential and could be much better.

yinyange28 November 2019
I had honestly lost all interest in Star Wars until deciding to watch this show. And boy am I glad I did. John Favreau's has saved the franchise in my eyes. I agree with another reviewer who said he should take over Lucas Film and do all the other Star Wars films and shows. The way it was filmed reminds me or the original trilogy, and I think George Lucas would be proud. The Mandalorian is my new favorite bounty hunter, step aside Bobba Fett. If your on the fence about watching it, do yourself a favor and at least watch the first episode. It got me hooked from the start.

This is what disney should have put out from the beginning, hand over the franchise to john favreau and take a seat disney.
conorgphillips24 November 2019
After watching the 3rd episode I can definitely count myself a fan of the mandalorian. As an old school star wars fan and of sci fi in general I've been completely disillusioned by Hollywood and the garbage being created lately. I haven't even watched most new films or shows for the last five years. This show however has gotten me hooked though. For the first time in years I not only eagerly look forward to each new episode but I beam like a total fanboy and practically jump out of my seat during the show. This is something that would fit flawlessly into the original extended universe right next to the best of them. The world is rich and gritty but isn't like the countless "gritty reboots" that lack heart and soul. This series feels like the characters and world actually had thought put into them and are going to be expanded upon in a proper way and proper time. Pedro Pascals portrayal has been very subtle and nuanced and is perfectly conveying the classic gunfight archetype of western films. And I'm loving his begrudging moments of sentimentality that conflict with his warrior like mandalorian upbringing. If you are a hardcore classic star wars fan like me then you'll love this show. Unlike the other films which don't bother to develop their flat characters this show starts slow and lets you acclimatize to new characters and setting. This isn't like the cookie cutter disney star wars films, this feels like it respects star wars and is worth watching. So give it a chance and hopefully disney will catch on. I also can't wait till they broaden the cast some more especially when they bring in Gina Carano. I can't wait to see what they do with her character.

marty-237-38697624 November 2019
Firstly, for the people who watched one episode and gave this one star, shame on you. Those people are an embarrassment to the Star Wars universe. They are probably the same people who gave that JJ Abrams abomination 10 stars!

What a brilliant show this is, written, created and directed by a true Star Wars fan. After watching three magnificent episodes I am already dreading the end of the season. Next up, another Abrams nightmare which will probably make 3 billion dollars. Star Wars fans are like Apple fans, they will continue to queue up for the next installment even though there are plenty of other superior items out there. Or maybe their like teenage girls at a Justin Bieber concert, all 5 foot 9 of no talent.

Anyway, no need to talk about this show, just watch it and enjoy the ride!

Put Simply, it's Excellent. I Have Spoken.
SmartGun21 November 2019
I won't lie I've dreamed of a Star Wars show like this ever since I can remember, and its astounding to me that there hasn't really been a live action Star Wars show done prior to this. The Galactic Underworld is by far my favourite aspect of Star Wars, so it's no surprise that I rate this so highly. Ever since reading about such criminal entities such as The Hutt Cartel, The Black Sun Syndicate, The Zann Consortium to name a few, I've been fascinated with the galaxies criminal underbelly. This show delivers that hive of and villainy vibe perfectly, and isn't afraid to show you it's grittier side in the process.

At its essence I think what makes The Mandalorian show so great, is that offers something old and something new. Fans of the original trilogy will feel more at home with this than say the prequels or sequels, but the way the story is set it also offers something we've never seen before. It's essentially a Spaghetti Western mixed in with a Space Opera with a sprinkling of classic Samurai tales. Immediately you're thrown into familar settings but not once do you feel like you've just retraced your steps, something that the sequels (in particular The Force Awakens) have been accused of.

One thing that really struck me was the quality of the production. Obviously I knew it was going to be high end stuff, but I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good. It's quite easily movie-level special effects, sounds, and camera work, and the action scenes as you may have guessed are of the highest calibre. Disney have definitely gone all out here and for that I'm very thankful.

Character wise Pedro Pascal does a wonderful job of portraying the hard-nosed Man(dalorian)-with-no-name (sorry couldn't resist :P) pivotal lead - a character I may add makes Han Solo in A New Hope seem like a saint. He has no qualms of delivering swift justice with a blaster to anyone who may stand in his way. Questionable morals aside, there is a underlying sense of honour, duty and respect which one would expect from a member of the Mandalorian culture. Likewise Nick Nolte's guiding Ugnaught "Kuiil" offers us a more level-headed and wisened character, much in the same way that Ben Kenobi did in the original movie. Last but not least, I really must mention IG-11, a Bounty/Assassin Droid that will most likely have you laughing as well as watching in awe as he goes about his business. I for one hope to see a lot more of him in future episodes.

So in summary, this is MUST-SEE Star Wars for any fans of the franchise. Both Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau clearly an have understanding of what SW fans want, and it's quite obvious their combined love of it shows in the end product. I can only hope Disney realise this and give them greater control in the future. We're only 2 episodes in at the time of me writing this review, and I for one find myself impatiently waiting for the next installment. One thing I will say, is that I wish these episodes were a bit longer as it's not helping my fix!

This is Star Wars and I'm hooked again
cbockiii21 November 2019
Someone on this production team finally got it right. Everything since Return of the Jedi (with some small exceptions in Force Awakens) has been garbage, but this show has completely recaptured what was cool about Star Wars.

The Jawa scenes in Episode 2 were spectacular. They're not just throwing old characters back into the mix for nastalgia, this really feels like an extension of the original story. Not to mention that the cinematography and music are exceptional.

Not to mention, I've always been a big Pedro Pascal fan and he fits perfectly for this show. But they're also nailing the side characters and they're all interesting.

Very, very well done, guys.

mikebalchaitis-5017419 November 2019
I am really loving The Mandalorian. I liked the last two Star Wars movies but I didn't love them. I love this series so far and it's only the first two episodes. I have to admit I am nervous. It's so close the edge of falling apart. Disney is riding a very fine line of action with cuteness.

Visually the show is amazing. It has the feel of a movie you would see in a theater. The CGI is top level as you would expect from disney. The music score is amazing almost too good for a series. I love it.

So far the story is very minimalist. And that's a good thing. I like this short compact episodes. Although they don't feel short they also don't feel boring. They really nailed it with pacing.

Not much else to say but I am can't wait for more.

This show feels like injecting pure Star Wars into your arteries
aidanalderdice15 November 2019
If The Last Jedi was a disease, The Mandalorian is the cure. The first 10 minutes of the pilot actually disappointed me, it felt incredibly cliche and some of the acting was painful to sit through. However, by the end, I had done a complete 180 and was ready to personally beg Disney for more. The action is absolutely fantastic, better than anything I think I've ever seen in any Star Wars movie, the protagonist is the best kind of mysterious while also being strangely charismatic, and the entire show has Jon Favreau's signature "funny without sacrificing tension" vibe.

It's absolutely brilliant. If only the movies were more like this.

I agree with who ever said this was a Space spaghetti western. Out here isnt the man with no name but the man with no face!. Its quick , not to much plot to get in the way of the action and there is plenty of that. Some funny bits but all in all its goodies vers baddies, in space. Great stuff. The end of the first esp(did he find who we all think he has found?).

littlepigs13 November 2019
As a casual fan I enjoyed the first episode but wasn't as riveted as a lot of the other reviewers. That said it's a highly quality show and has a great production team and cast.

The end had a nice surprise so I will continue watching to see how the series develops

Why Should I Bother Watching if I didn't like the Sequel Trilogy?
zanghi_james21 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
If I don't like the sequel trilogy that J.J., Kathleen, and Rian Johnson created, then why should I watch what is essentially the prequel and backstory to it? Why? We know that Baby Yoda will most likely get killed off because he makes no appearance whatsoever in the Sequel Trilogy and neither does the Mandalorian. We know that the show is basically the telling of how Luke Skywalker fell into cowardice and Han and Leia breaking up after their easily-manipulated son becomes Kylo Ren. It's kind of pointless, really. So, Disney, why bother???

Finally.....Star Wars!
zain-y-shah12 November 2019
This is the Star Wars we've been craving for years. An original story with great characters and set. This feels like the original Star Wars. No cheesy one liners, an intriguing story and a strong lead character. Hope they continue with this style. I'm all about making money, but at least produce quality tv that satisfies the viewer. The last 2 movies failed to do that.......hopefully this will change my view on how Disney treats Star Wars.

Actual Rating 9.5 / 10
DadmanTN12 November 2019
Actual Rating 9.5/10 - This (episode one and two anyway) is the Star Wars I've been waiting on. (Seen twice already) It has a very New Hope feel with a Rogue One darkness but moves like Rebels. The cast is absolutely outstanding and it's just so great without all the identity politics junk of late that ruined Last Jedi. The only knock would be the music / score was very different from the usual Star Wars themed music but it's not bad. Possibly different on purpose to show a different aspect of that universe. They may integrate the Jedi score later. Either way I have very high hopes for this show. Oh! And the end of Ep 1 was totally not expected but pretty dang cool! Great job Jon Favrreau.

I must to love this series because here Baby Yoda???
shaokahn-5442510 January 2020
The already dirty Star Wars universe, which stops at a deliberately falling rating, shoved Yoda into the commercial baby. What's the matter with Star Wars? Where is your former honor? The series is weak, weak extras. Moreover, frankly speaking, people are tired of the series, films and animated series of this universe.

Meh?
decaturskid9 January 2020
The Mandalorian is the plain girl in a room full of piglets. She looks beautiful only because the bar has been set so low. In truth, it's not so bad compared to the rest of the garbage Disney has been pumping out. When I first saw the baby Yoda I thought those star squiggly ampersands are complete geniuses. There going to make a gozillion dollars on that. Then they didn't make one in time for Christmas so not so much genius as I thought. It really is just average. They haven't shoved a lot of PC garbage in it yet, but get a good grip on something solid for season 2. It's Disney and they've proven they can't keep their mouths shut. Not even for money. It's worth a watch.

Why add so many stupid characters?
private100030 December 2019
Why would you want to fill a cool concept as this with as many poorly and bad written characters as possible? It's a c-movie show, looking at it all.

When will producers start seeing value beyond corporate and start making art as movies are supposed to be.... At least kinda.

A Fistful of Dollars in space
hugomf8523 December 2019
Take Clint Eastwood, give him a mask, put him in the Star Wars universe and you got yourself a pretty good show. This show is very entertaining and it feels like Star Wars, unlike the Disney trilogy. You don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to enjoy The Mandalorian, nor do you need to know the backstory. It's just a plus if you do because some plot points will be heightened. It's very well written, the dialogues feel real and the comedy is on the right spots. Finally something good happening for Star Wars since The Return Of The Jedi in 1983. This feels better than the prequel trilogy by Lucas himself. It's the right direction. Congratulations to everyone involved in the creation of this show!

Elements...
Highfield-ORIGINAL22 December 2019
I usually don't write much reviews cause i just enjoy some movies, and there are some i don't.

This series gave me something back i didnt thought of. If you know Sabine and the other mandalorian (Star Wars Rebels, great animated series), you feel home at the beginning of season 1.

Why? You see the Mandalorian unit, the gear, what they work for and what kind of people they are. You get a great Storyline from the beginning to the end, you get action, drama, comedy (in a light way) and a really good plot so far (watched till episode 7 so far).

This series is like a big movie for me and i cant wait to watch more and more. Not only because of the cute baby Yoda, but because the storytelling, the story itself and the great characters make a real "rogue one" like feel, as an adult production for all Star Wars lovers out there.

Thank you! I want to see more!

Set aside that this is Star Wars...
amoore-413 December 2019
With all of the amazing TV series we now have at our enjoyment, would you rate this series 9.1? I doibt it. Without getting into the show itself, let me say it's good. "Expanse" good? Close, but no. Expanse is far more multilevel and deeper, and it gets a lower rating. Watch episode 4 (after the first three of course) and ask yourself if that weak episode cuts it. No it doesn't. A good series so far and with a forth of sci-fi at the moment and living in an Orville universe, the Mandalorian is appreciated.

Fantastic Series So Far
jh-9650713 December 2019
I gotta say, with how bad the newest Star Wars trilogy has been, and how boring I found Solo, I had low expectations for this series but I have been very pleasantly surprised.

The show feels original and interesting, while clearly being inspired by Westerns and set in the Star Wars universe. It gives off a similar vibe to Rogue One, which I think is the only recent Star Wars film that's been worth watching.

The episodes so far have been pretty uneven, with the first three being fantastic, while the fourth was the weakest in my opinion and Chapter 5 being interesting with an intriguing teaser ending. I am very interested to see where this series goes from here and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I've been enjoying so far.

Batman meets Dirty Harry
jwag77710 December 2019
Entertaining show so far, although the writers aren't giving much away in regards to a back story of the main characters. Just a weekly action show right now. But the Mandalorian is an intriguing character, even Batman-esque in look, complete with cape and assortment of gadgets. Unfortunately, his Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry-type low-key, raspy voice is hard to understand sometimes. Requires my volume to be higher than on most shows. Curious to see where it goes.

The missing link in the Post-Empire Story. More human, with a place to go from there.
PowerSheetAI6 December 2019
The premier was everything I'd hoped for in what is finally a live-action Star Wars series. A bit of humor, without overdoing it. The anti-hero was a bit more human and fallible than expected - but then again, no one comes close to Boba Fett. However, that does make for a more realistic story, and leaves it with someplace to go. The chance to learn more about the Mandalorian armor is a nice touch. I'm happy to see this is in a post-imperial setting, vs. yet another prequel. I just wish the premiere was longer. I can't wait for the next episode!

The Mandalorian is an instant success.
gcwheaton-709-2748904 December 2019
The Mandalorian has all the elements for a successful show and it delivers them well. Star Wars has always been geared towards a young audience and The Mandalorian is no different. But the cute and funny moments are just that, cute and funny but it works very well. No eye rolling here yet.

Through 4 episodes there have been many cool and interesting characters, scenes and moments in general that keep you in anticipation for the next episode. Great writing too.

Finally !
laurentdelvigne-446-5869731 December 2019
I did not have any hope anymore on the current trilogy: incoherent plot, no attachment to the current characters, and not talking about the treatment of the original cast (RIP Carrie Fischer).

Simple reason: the movies were released too fast (+ the spins off). Because Disney wanted to apply the same Marvel recipe. It did not work.

But damned, this series is great: starting slow (episodes 1 and 2) and then takes off.

Thanks to Jon Favreau & Dave Feloni, true SW lovers, and you have a magnificent project (I loved the animated Clones and Rebels).

If it is the famous "course correction" read in the press at the end of 2018, it is !

Jon Favreau saves Star Wars
thecaptain-390-6868581 December 2019
Just like he did with Marvel, Favreau has made Star Wars what it is supposed to be. Not some anthem or some other dumb stuff. Instead you have a solid story set in the Star Wars Universe and while sipping back into the past at moments with references or stories, it creates an interesting and unique storyline. The characters and acting are on point as well.

I started watching this series with a clean slate of expectation but after watching the first 4 episodes it completely blew my mind. The plot is tight and the screenplay is on point. A particular popular starwars character can't get more adorable than the present representation. I can't wait for the upcoming episodes. Christmas just seem to have come early for us. :)

The Mandalorian is Star Wars at its best
chema-650311 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I'm following the journey of The Mandalorian episode by episode.

Episode 4 begins with Mando as a child when his tribe is attacked by dog like faced scavengers. They destroy the entire village, taking everything valuable. We get another glimpse of why Mando is attached to the kid, he sees the resemblance in both of their situations.

Mando & Kid venture out to Sorgan, a planet with no port & in appearance rather docile. Clearly, they seek refuge on this planet. At a bar their is a mysterious woman who Mando suspects right away. Upon searching for her after her quick departure, they get into a equilibrated fight. This is Cara, an Endor native. This character is very appealing & mystical. There is an immediate between Mando & Cara. This relationship will flourish at a later stage.

Before we know it Cara is back & they help to young farmers who require assistance by way of protection of their farm from scavengers. Mando, Cara & Kid journey to the farm, where Mando is clearly reminded of his childhood again. Life seems good on the farm with happy families & children.

I find it amazing that Mando has not taken his mask off since he was a child after his parents were killed & he was taken in by the Mandalorians. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place. He never lets anyone see him without his mask on! Why?

Mando & Cara stumble into an imperial walker while surveying the land around the farm. What is the significance of this? They try to convince the farmers to leave their farm but settle to train the farmers how to protect themselves. I like the Cara character. She's elusive yet has a strong character & emotional semblance which draws the viewer to her.

One night Mando & Cara attack the scavengers & we see that they are the same dog like faced scavengers that killed Mando's family. The imperial walker trails Mando & Cara trying to destroy them, & I feel like I am in Return of the Jedi on Endor. Things are heating up. A nice battle ensues between the scavengers, armed with the imperial walker they have acquired after the fall of the empire, & Mando, Cara & the farmers trained to fight. Its pure Star Wars adrenaline. Cara immobilises the imperial walker & Mando destroys it. The action sequences remind me of the battle of Endor. The special effects are superb.

Mando reveals that if he ever takes off his helmet, he can never put it back on. It the Mandalorian tradition. Mandi is going to leave Kid on Sorgan where he is safe & away from danger.

We catch a glimpse of a mystical figure with a tracking device. Who is he looking for? Mando? Kid? Cara? This is a developing sub-plot.

One of the farmer women tries to take off Mando's mask. He steadfastly refuses. Upon telling her that he is leaving but Kid is staying as he is safe. It is here that the mysterious character who is a bounty hunter tries to hone in on Kid but Cara takes him out just in time. I really like the Cara character.

Mando sees that it is not safe on Sorgan as bounty hunters will be constantly on the look out hunting them down to reclaim Kid.

So Mando & Kid leave. They need to keep moving so as not to be traced. Where will they go next?

There is something very appealing about The Mandalorian. Kid is central to the plot. Why is he so important? Who wants him? Why do they want him? Does he know something about the empire or the scattered resistance?

The Mandalorian is evolving intriguingly with an excellent plot with substantial sub plots & plot twists. It truly is an excellent adaptation of the Star Wars family genre. I cannot wait to see what is in stall for us in upcoming episodes. This is one of the most invigorating Star Wars stories I have seen.

Every episode depicts an interesting but very small achievement
ecvoid30 November 2019
Who doesn't like a bad boy? Well, I don't! I had to sit through 2 episodes to get to the Mandalorian's moral turning point. Everybody, I think, was expecting it. But it got segmented into two episodes. Two short episodes... Why didn't they conceive this show with episodes of an hour? As they stand they don't have the actual air time to present a fully developed segment of the story. Each one of them presents the viewer a small adventure. And here lies the problem: not many things happen in one "chapter". It makes the Mandalorian's actions seem unimpressive. He enters the stage, does ONE thing and then he flies away in his ship. This show has potential but it suffers from its blitzkrieg presentation.

Supersedes Expectations
adage-3177921 November 2019
Wow! This is such a refreshing spin off story following the Mandalorian five years after the 1983 Return of the Jedi and after the Empire fell.

With a western shoot em up feel but sticking closely to the way the original Star Wars were filmed, watching it is both nostalgic and novel.

Love the pace, the easy back story to the Mandalorian and how it removes itself from as much of the CG of today as possible.

So excited for more episodes!

So Refreshing, what Star Wars should be!
schraufnageld21 November 2019
My expectations were low when I sat down to view The Mandalorian. The previous Star Wars movies were so bad I expected the same nonsense. And to my astonishment The Mandalorian was good, it was really good. The opening scene at the cantina was great, they finally did it with practical effects I was shocked. The CGI was done correctly as well, not the overuse cartoon like in the prequels. It was subtle and looked great!

As I watched the two episodes I didn't feel any propaganda or social views pushed in my face, it felt like I was watching Star Wars again. However, one scene stood out to me, the scene when the Mandalorian was walking through town and they were cooking Jabba the hutt's pet. It's clear the intent is to eat it, could this be a poke in the face of Rain Johnson? It's very similar to Rain Johnson's The Last Jedi when Chewie is going to eat the Prog but doesn't due to being guilt tripped by the Prog's face. Could this just be a coincidence?

Anyway The Mandalorian delivered on the story as well, I was pleasantly surprised at the end of the first episode when we find out his bounty. Really interesting, and I look forward to the next episodes. Side note: The battle droid was pretty awesome, a great western feel to it. I really enjoyed this droid, great nostalgia as well. This droid is in the Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader puts a bounty on the Millenium Falcon. So good!

A beautiful Phoenix arises from the Star Wars ashes
romanosdaniel20 November 2019
I liked John Favreau as an actor (loved the Replacements), but didn't realise how good he was at writing.

I loved this show from the very start of the very first episode. I have only seen two episodes thus far but, this is Star Wars as it was always supposed to be. A bunch of interesting and fun stories with an adventure type feel. It is as if Favreau looked at all the mistakes that the current crop of movies made and basically fixed them. Gone is the "broom closet" (we can get anywhere instantly, weapons fire in a flash across many light years, and by the way we can travel a mile through a wood in 20 seconds etc.) feel of the galaxy that JJ has the habit of producing in favour of something much more realistic where a planet feels as big as, well... a planet, space travel is hard, and things need repairing before they work. Gone is the moralising condescending attitude and back is the storytelling. You know, there is a hero (even if they are flawed), and they try to do their best and there are a bunch of adventures along the way often not connected to the main plot because that is what stories are. The hero becomes heroic through the events of the story - they are not fully formed from the beginning. This was my main problem with the Force Awakens and the Last Jedi - they made out that you can be this perfect person from the start with no training and no life experience even if all you had done thus far was scavenge material from old star destroyers. This show doesn't have that. There is a bounty hunter who is very capable but he has to change radically even in the first couple of episodes. He has to get help from those who have their own reasons for helping rather than because they believe some left wing narrative about what the politically correct thing to do is. Overall, this has great production values (good to great CGI) and a proper feel for old world Star Wars - it's set post Empire and all the sets match up to that. A great set of characters and very good actors (I think I recognised Bert from BBT and friends as the speeder driver). It has a whole bunch of funny bits and this Mandalorian whilst impressive doesn't by any means have it all his own way. Some surprises too which is nice to see. Finally a production worthy of the name Star Wars. Bravo Mr Favreau!

My Interest In Star Wars Was Flat lining, This Show Has Resuscitated it!
retroid-0000920 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Disney killed my interest big time for Star Wars these last few years both with the movies and games. The only diamond in the rough was the Star Wars Rebels TV show for me. Dave Filloni was the only one that seemed to still "get" Star Wars and it is about time he was given a better project than an animated TV show so others can be informed of his talent. His skills do indeed carry over to live action and he has shown more competence within these first two short episodes than 4 movies, two videogames and one animated show (resistance) have shown with their big budgets!

Disney need to seriously start hiring staff for Star Wars based on skills, talent and experience instead of diversity! You can have the most diverse team in the world but if they are not competent at giving customers what they want and earn money for the franchise then they need to go!

Some points i love about the series so far are:

The struggle - The Mandalorian has so far had his ass handed to him at times and i love it! In the first episode i was expecting him to back flip onto a beast that attacks him, or something. But i am glad it was the opposite, nothing more satisfying than seeing a character struggle, grow, become stronger and seeing the process of how they become an ultimate bad ass.


The Armour Upgrades - I love what has been done here especially been a fan of videogames. It is obvious that along the series the mandalorian will be upgrading pieces of his armour from the worn out looking red tinted armour he currently has. To the nice new, shiny, strong silver looking metal that was taken from Mandalor by the Empire. Reminds me of Metroid ha.


-The ending to the first episode! Love that we look to be FINALLY getting some lore on a certain mysterious race that we have barely had any info on for decades now, cannot wait to see where they go with this!

-He never takes his helmet off! - Too many movies and shows do not do this enough! Biggest example was the 90s Judge Dredd movie! Which they fixed in the Dredd remake, glad to see they have stayed true to the Mandalorians here.

-Not much dialogue & no cheesy humor! - This really adds to the mood, also although there isn't much speaking there are still plenty of aliens speaking and it has been so good to hear some familiar languages and voices. The best part is also NO CHEESY JOKES! It is not devoid of humor but it doesn't have the giddy, "not taking the situation seriously" humor the new movies seemed to be infested with really takes you out of the immersion.

I could go on to be honest but my hands are tired from typing so i will finish by saying GO WATCH THIS NOW! IN ANYWAY YOU CAN!!!

There's no way that jon favreau creatively created this show. It's like trying to find the missing link. You have on the one side, a semi creative force that's got spark but no compression then on the other side you've got a runaway train. Even george lucas never told a better story. It's got some misfires but wow it's about time. But, hey george, you're not getting any more of my gift shop/toy shop money no matter what you do.

robbnsjeanz16 November 2019
The visuals are on point , the director understands the old movies with character development, a really good star wars vibe like the old ones when you really want and need to see more, i watched the first episode last night thinking i would fall asleep in 10 minutes, half an hour later i was so excited to see the next one i instantly played the next episode. 9/10 just because the episodes are 30 minutes , please make them longer lasting , i think i speak for everyone when i say this. 10/10 with a longer 45:00 - 55:00 would absolutely blow my mind and be a more immersive cinematic experience. Congratulations Jon Favreau, you really delivered and made probably tens of milions watch star wars again with the same passion.

This could become the best of Star Wars! -- see the movies, see the animated series, now see this!
kdean-515 November 2019
First, I'm not talking about books or expanded universe; in talking about things brought to Star Wars canon on big screen and home television. In order to fully express myself about The Mandalorian, I first have a comment about Star Wars prior to The Mandalorian. I have enjoyed all of the Star Wars movies, and like many other people, I enjoyed none nearly as much as the original trilogy. Since the originals, there have been movies that were fun and had there positives, including great character moments (I.e. droids with great lines and personalities), some good battles, some fun seeing the return of beloved characters, and I for one enjoyed the politics and intrigue and Palpatine's schemes in the prequels. But, I feel the animated series succeeded in renewing and enhancing my love of Star Wars unlike anything since the original trilogy. I liked both the stories *and* the characters from Clone Wars and Rebels more than any movies since the original trilogy. In fact, I would go so far as to say my favorite Star Wars characters of all time are from Clone Wars and Rebels. They even made me like a character previously didn't like from movies. And, they were able to develop and expand on stories, characters, groups, concepts and backgrounds (such as clones), and, they did it very, very well. The animated series are the best of Star Wars canon since the trilogy in my mind. My only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, is that they were animated instead of live action. I remember thinking, this is great; if they could make this live action, I could it more than the original trilogy. I thought, the best thing for Star Wars would be if some of the people who made Clone Wars and Rebels so great would participate in the creation of a well done live action Star Wars series that takes time to develop great characters and ongoing stories. And, now, after seeing the first episode of The Mandalorian, I have hope that could actually be happening right now. And it's important to remember, this is a series, not a movie. The first episode of Rebels reminded me of the movie Aladdin, and I wasn't really on board, but it became every bit as good as Clone Wars and had some awesome characters and stories. The first episode of The Mandalorian was in my mind better than the first episode of Rebels. And it is just the beginning. We are used to seeing live action Star Wars in the form of a stand alone movie or trilogy. If the first episode of The Mandalorian was, say, the first of a trilogy of movies, I might feel like it didn't develop his character fast enough, or didn't give us enough in certain areas. But this is a series. In the first episode they already started a new story that feels original to me; they captured a lot of the essence of Star Wars, and there was some good humor, cool battles, and he (The Mandalorian) met a character I fell in love with in minutes (IG) - all much like the animated series, but live action! And, they are just getting started! I am excited to see the main character develop, learn more about his background, see the stories unfold, and fall in love with more new amazing characters I am confident they will introduce. And on a side note, I really hope to see a lot of The Force, force users, and hopefully an aged character or two from Clone Wars or Rebels can make an appearance. That would make my day. Anyway, many of the best series I've ever seen took a while to get into the groove, but I think the Mandalorian is off to a great start. I happily purchased a year of the streaming service just for this show, and I anticipate no regrets. If you liked Clone Wars or Rebels, I highly recommend this series. If you liked the characters or stories in any of the movies, or like Star Wars at all, I recommend this series.

Somebody has actually got this right for once! I put this and Rogue One on my best Star Wars off shoots of this millennium.

I believe the producers and writers really did there home work, not just money grabbing but really enjoying what they've done and sharing it with us all.

Could we even see a Obiwan cross over?????????

Now THIS is star wars
sterkemartin14 November 2019
This Mandalorian has a perfect cast, perfect music and AMAZING cinematography! This show REALLY gets the vibe and feeling of the star wars universe perfectly right! The characters are unbelievable good, so many iconic quotes after just ONE episode! This is no doubt the best star wars Since Disney bought Lucasfilm. Can't believe I'm saying this but it's on the same level as the originals. This truly deserves a 10/10.

Star Wars Space Western
applebury_pie14 November 2019
I was extremely hopefully this show wouldn't disappoint. Especially with episode 8 almost tanking the franchise for me And I'm a die hard Star Wars fan. So believe me when I say after only one episode Im addicted! Im very excited to see where Favreau takes the show. Pedro Pascal does an amazing job giving depth and emotion to a character we not only know nothing about but also never removes his helmet.

Fair Modern Western Interpretation
tim-3131525 January 2020
John Wayne was better, his facial expressions added to the scene. A rehash of Western genre and old Star Wars background without a new take that would attract sci-fi fans. We live in a time where we seem to get all our energy from batteries. They seem to have no drive systems, let alone miniature batteries that endlessly power lasers and hovercrafts that - on the other end of the technology spectrum - seem to have aiming systems that indeed befit the Western analogy. With no real sci-fi value, I rather see a well made Western, or watch reruns of Moonbase Alpha!

decaturskid9 January 2020
The Mandalorian is the plain girl in a room full of piglets. She looks beautiful only because the bar has been set so low. In truth, it's not so bad compared to the rest of the garbage Disney has been pumping out. When I first saw the baby Yoda I thought those star squiggly ampersands are complete geniuses. There going to make a gozillion dollars on that. Then they didn't make one in time for Christmas so not so much genius as I thought. It really is just average. They haven't shoved a lot of PC garbage in it yet, but get a good grip on something solid for season 2. It's Disney and they've proven they can't keep their mouths shut. Not even for money. It's worth a watch.

Entertaining but uneven
gaetanbouchard1 January 2020
Fun to watch but it could be better with better actors. Pedro Pascal is fine but it could be anybody else since we never (almost) see is facial expressions. Some of the character are exaggerated to a point where they become ridiculous. One of the episode is basically a clostrophobic fight between robots and a pseudo team, repetitive, long and boring that was. Some of the special effex are movie quality but other scenes are so bad that they reminded me of the 60s original Batman TV series with Adam West.

Do quest, upgrade armour, repeat, snooze.
cloudmonkey-896-97014430 December 2019
The Mandalorian. Just watched season 1. It was like that game where you do a quest, kill the boss, get upgraded armour, repeat for 8 episodes. Dont get me wrong, it was okish, but not what i read in the reviews. I'm thinking a lot of bots have been leaving 10/10 reviews as the storyline is paper thin. The character of the Mandalorian himself is a but dumb, easily lead and easy to cross. Only the repetitive dumb luck ex machina moments save him over and over and over. Yeah this was pretty average viewing.

This is what Star Wars should be
seanjames-2311327 December 2019
I found this tv series more intriguing and desirable than the latest Star Wars film and this is due to the story and how the mandalorian tells a story which all fans would enjoy and this tv series doesn't just appeal to old fans but new ones aswell as it isn't connected to the old and new movies which helps people get a taste of what Star Wars should be and how it should make the audience feel.

Now I'm not a great fan of the latest star wars movies but someone said to me watch it, it's really good. Wow..I love it & can't wait to see the next episode. Very well thought out, great characters, great story & fab effects. This is a spin off which I feel works far better than the films! I'm looking forward to seeing much more of this.

At first i was skeptic about it, since 2015 all the star wars movies have been total and utter crap. But as always i watch stuff before judging and Mandalorian turned out to be something magnificent. The writing is spot on, visuals look like big budget movie and everything else incredible!

If you are still thinking if you should watch it then theres no need to think more, JUST DO IT!

This is what we've all been waiting for since the original trilogy.

My only gripe is they aren't long enough but I'll take quality over quantity any day. Still getting my head around the fact Pete from friends created this lol. An absolute delight on the senses.

bhernandez22164 December 2019
The Mandalorian is the #1's biggest hit of Star Wars history, one of the best Star Wars tv show on Disney+. Baby Yoda steals the whole entire show in the galaxy, far far, away. The Mandalorian will make you believe in Star Wars, all over again, and you can see Baby Yoda in The Mandalorian again, and again.

I have not been a fan of the recent Star Wars movies. Nowhere as good as the older ones. Nor the actors sadly. But The Mandalorian has made me love Star Wars once again. What an awesome show, with great acting, stories and scenes. Always loved Jon Favreau, he has been just great in everything he does.

patriciaeham1 December 2019
Just enough back story so that you empathize with the main character but not so much that you get bored. Enough action to keep everyone happy and no campy humour or ridiculous love story. A gunslinger saddled with a "dependant" is a familiar story but this is not boring or predictable. Can't wait to see if disney makes others

Excellent, this is Star Wars as it meant to be
micglou30 November 2019
Is Jon Favreau the most underestimated producer/director in Hollywood? I think so, you never hear talks of him in the mix, but this man could be held responsible for catapulting the MCU into the stratosphere... and now he's doing it with the excellent 'The Mandalorian'. This is was a modern production of Star Wars should look, feel and sound like... he should've done the new movie trilogy because this tv show is close to perfection.

My hat goes off to Jon Favreau, this is more than great to watch.

rsvp32129 November 2019
I've watched all three currently available episodes several times, already. Each time I've seen something previously missed, there's just so much sci fi detail to enjoy!

Every minute is meaningful to the plot, ie no wasted time as filler.

I mean that about the writers - we've all seen Hollywood squander *so many* opportunities for series or movies by adding agenda garbage, or hack talents.

Stay on course! Looking forward to a 50 year run!

More please!...
rrichards8420 November 2019
I grew up watching Star Wars. I was mesmerized from day one. As I grew older I began to appreciate the subtleties, and the nuances. I had a more refined palet for the story and found it to be deeper then the base story. I read the books. And in doing so, I cherished the hair standing on the back of my neck and suffered the arcs that raised an eyebrow, for more of this galaxy, far, far away. The opening scene gave rise to something I immediately knew... (Do you remember your favorite meal as a child?... Like an addiction, even a decade or two later you will salivate to taste your memory, and the dish that brought such a joy that your nape again, finds its chill...did you feel it?) You make it yourself simply based on memory and though the profile is marginally different, you still flash back to exactly what you remember. The perfection here is not in the accuracy, but what it recalls in your mind......

How deliciously perfect...

Haven't been a fan of Disney's recent offerings, but this is something that I'm really enjoying so far. The cinematography is exceptional, the CGI is well placed and the acting is only going to get better as the series gets kicked into full speed. If it seems a too fast paced, put your phone down! So far, The Mandalorian seems to have really captures that old Star Wars vibe and I'm enjoying it. Despite the relatively short episodes, the story is being written nicely and I can't wait to see it unfold.

Congratulations for the series !!!! Very good so far, finally a good director John Favreau, good script !!!! It was great to see some of the classic trilogy

Probably SW VII, VIII Part I would have been a lot better to watch if J. Favreau was directing and writing than J.J anyone .... Part IX is almost certain to be bad because of a bad director and director .....

But the series is Super !!!

cherchezan14 November 2019
Loved the first episode, felt like Star Wars. Now we just have to figure out how to delete episodes 7-9 and Solo from our memory and we're good. There wasn't that much story in it but it had some elements that definitely hooked me, as a huge fan of the classics and massive hater of the last 3 episodes. It left me curious and happy that the Star Wars I felt in love with is back. Mystery, crazy, far far away world that is a western and an adventure story in space. Hope they won't ruin this as it was the first actually good Star Wars made by Disney after Rogue One. The future episodes will decide how this turns up but the start was beautiful and I can't wait for more.

tgbriggs-114 November 2019

Ok let's do so math, Anakin was 20ish when Luke was born, and 40ish when he died. So the new show takes place around 10 years after return of the Jedi so does this make the little Yoda born the same time as Anakin. So could this be the chosen one?????

Too early to tell
samyoung-8264813 November 2019
Many reviewers are calling this the proper StarWars. To put it bluntly, I have no investment with any of the characters, especially as the main character is hidden behind a helmet and you see and feel no attachment to the character.

Disney has also played far too much politik with the StarWars franchise, so, I am waiting to see how things unfold. If Disney plays its usual hand, I'm expecting the politik to come in after several episodes in a heavy-handed way.

I did not feel this was StarWars other than a few of the costumes. There is not one character I care about or empathise with. The main character is "too cool". However, the show has promise.

The sets are good. The pacing is good. I'll give Favreau credit for this being less "Kennedy" and more "Lucas". However, everyone should wait until the season is well progressed. I think we all learned (or should have learned) from West World that took 1/2 a season to play politik.

Be wary of early enthusiasm.

I'm not a Star Wars fan
zocress21 December 2019
I'm not a Star Wars fan, I grew up with the prequels, I watched the originals and I caught the sequals in the cinema. Mainly I watch Star Wars because the design is so amazing that it is one of the only sci-fi universes I can get behind.

The Mandalorian carries on the tradition of truly brilliant design work. It is a beautiful series, that maintains the vibe of the original trilogy. But this also comes at a price, because the series has fallen into the fanbase catering trap. There is an irrational hatred for CGI in the Star Wars fanbase community. We all remember how CGI was butchered in the prequels and the sequals have proven that a mix of puppets and CGI is the way to make the best looking movie possible. Though the Mandalorian seems to have chosen to neglect CGI, when it comes to their most iconic character nicknamed Baby Yoda. Actually it works amazingly though out the first couple of episodes, but as soon as Baby Yoda have to move, especially his arms, it has this comically old puppet look, that only Star Wars fans can love. But the Mandalorian also shows full CGI creatures, that is only passable, because it is a TV series. My point being, that the overall look of the series is great, especially for a TV series, it has gaps that seems to be partly caused by catering to a fan base, that just want to go back to their childhood. As said, I'm not a Star Wars fan, neither am I a hater. I'm a VFX student, and I have seen what Disney can do, I'm just sat to see them being held back by fans who refuse to let the franchise grow.

Over all it is a great show and if you have any warm feelings for the Star Wars universe, you're going to love it.

vulture067 December 2019
This is already a space western classic. Everything here is from the original Star Wars universe. I love everything about this show. It's got a 1970's vibe. Even the terrific theme music has a classical spaghetti western feel. And baby Yoda is sooo cute. Kudos to Jon Favreau and Disney. Easily deserves a 10.

Keeps getting better
chema-650317 December 2019
The Mandalorian jut keeps on getting better & better..

I love that it tries to keep all the anthological perspectives of the Star Wars brand yet introducing innovative stories & plots.

I think if given time to build the story, and letting it develop, it could be a really good show.

It has it all to be successful: a strong main character which is illusive yet likeable. It has very good secondary characters. The Child is by far the most that needs to be explored.

As someone who was a young child when all the Star Wars movies came out, I'm finding the show melancholic of how original the Star Wars franchise was & always will be.

Best Star Wars since Empire
iamtheuf5 December 2019
This is what Star Wars fans have been waiting for, content that is so obviously good we don't have much to argue about amongst ourselves.

Everything about this show is incredible. The costumes, set designs, acting, sound effects, and music all fit together perfectly to make it feel like you're there. Disney knocked it out of the park by picking Jon Favreau. I want him to get his own series.

The pacing can feel slow at times, but it's intentional. The story guilds anticipation very well which makes the great action sequences all that more special.

The show also builds on Star Wars lore in unique ways, giving a satisfying sense of world building that has been missing in recent movies.

Stop reading my review and go watch it. You won't regret it.

Sorry to say this but this puts the recent Star Wars movies to shame. It's so damn good and my only complaint would be that the episodes are too freaking short. I need moreeeee

The visuals of this show are amazing, it feels like Rogue One in that it has darker more mysterious undertones. The acting is on point and I can't wait to see who else is brought in. The story keeps you interested and wanting more! I love the look and feel of this show, definitely does a service to expanding the Star Wars universe for true fans.

I love this show, from the world building, to the characters, to the CGI, to the storyline. I've loved every episode so far, except for episode 5. That one was decent. The best thing about the series is baby Yoda using the force. 😁

Well worth watching - even if you are not a Star Wars fan
craig-snell-151-14942722 December 2019
I'm shocked by how many negative reviews there is of this, it's an excellent show that satisfies Star Wars geeks, and just general TV watchers. Yes it is based in a galaxy far far away, but you don't have know your R2-D2's from your jar jar binks to like this show. I have seen many reviews comparing this to westerns of bygone era's albeit set in space, but to me it's more a feudal Japan with roaming samurai's protecting the land.

OK, there is a certain small green being (no spoilers) that do smack of commercialism, but from what I have read they had not expected the impact and hadn't created the t-shirts and plush toys that you would have expected.

Back to the show, the CGI isn't bad, I mean it's not even in the vicinity of supermans moustache removal, but it's not quite up there with dragons on game of thrones, but you have to remember, that this is its first season, and game of thrones was the biggest show on the planet when the CG was top notch.

Could this become the biggest show on the planet, no I don't think so, but it is a really good show, and well worth a watch, and to all the naysayers out there. I will say, like or like not, there is no try.

Its a Star Wars movie in miniature
english_artist17 December 2019
Every episode of this is just like a Star Wars movie in miniature. It has all the action the humour and the HUGE budget and brilliant special effects of any Star Wars movie or in fact any movie at all

I think Disney have set the bar really high with this series for others to follow it really sets a president of all other series to follow - if they can

Superb !!

2 Episodes in and it feels like a masterpiece, not bad
MichelW21021 November 2019
Wow, did I love these first two episodes. Not only did Disney FINALLY hire the right people, this does feel like ACTUAL Star Wars and I'm so glad we finally get an actual series from a bounty hunter /mandalorians perspective. When I heard Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni are making this, I had hope, but I thought Disney would screw it again, thanks for not doing so.

If somebody told me Clone Wars Season 7 wasn't the best we'd get from Disney, I would have called them crazy back then, but damn Mandalorian could actually be the best Star Wars Show ever.

Yes this show is actually THAT good, it's all I ever wanted in a way. And Disney: please stay with the Old Republic movie plan!

Star Wars the way I remember it.
TLWilkerson13 November 2019
From the opening sequence, I got the feeling of the old Star Wars Expanded Universe novels. The first episode felt like it was right out of Tales Of The Bounty Hunters. I loved the visuals and the grittiness that has always been the hallmark or peripheral Star Wars characters.

anickell-8870713 November 2019
The Mandalorian had a great first show. This feels like the Star Wars that a mature audience has deserved for years. It has the past of a lone western gunslinger movie. Almost a galactic Clint Eastwood in the Good Bad and the Ugly. I am looking forward to seeing the Mandalorian grow as a character. There wasn't any sophomoric humor, it was a serious show that deserves everyone's attention.

Simply Amazing
joeisboss13 November 2019
The pilot episode of this show was amazing. Every scene was great and the fight scenes were greatly choreographed. I loved the first intro scene, and the end battle scene was also awesome. The filler scenes were enjoyable and fun to watch. This is my favorite pilot episode ever, better than TWD's imo. I loved this and can't wait to see where it goes. And the ending was compelling as well!

The Mandalorian: Star Wars gloriously rebounds!
ToeCutterZero12 November 2019
I've just finished watching the first episode and all I have to say is "WOW!"

The "Mando" is unadulterated, old-school Star Wars! This is certainly a very different kind of story than we're used to from Star Wars, but it all fit so nicely within the Star Wars universe. From the polished set design right down to the details of how the droids move, Favreau and Filoni (who directed Ep 1) have simply nailed it. Everything looks as if it were filmed right after ROTJ, only with better SFX. Regarding SFX: I can't see anyone being disappointed. The FX look great, indistinguishable from the feature films. The use of models, prosthetics and puppets gives everything a genuine quality that CGI simply cannot match. Example: The Razor Crest looks even better than the Millennium Falcon from the Disney sequels. It's looks tangibly real, while the "new" CG'ed Falcon looks like high resolution gaming graphics. And not a single scene was wasted on gratuitous nonsense; each scene added something to the story. It's a serious show with some phenomenal story-telling. It's also clear that this show was intended for adults, even though it'll certainly appeal to kids as well.

I kept my hopes for the show within reason considering all the issues we've seen from Disney's new Star Wars films. Even so, my expectations were completely annihilated! THIS is what I expected from modern Star Wars and I'm so pleased with the results. With all the tension and uncertainty surrounding the imminent release of JJ Abrams second Star Wars film (Rise of Skywalker) next month, it's a huge relief to see that Star Wars still has so much to offer when the stories are told by the right folks. Favreau and Filoni may have just saved Disney's Star Wars, it's that good! I could bear not even seeing Ep 9 knowing we have 8 more episodes of The Mandalorian to watch.

-2 for not having any 'wooom wooom' sounds, but still good
0w07 December 2019
MORE COWBELL! is an appropriate meme for this series, except instead of need more cowbell, this series needs more lightsabers.

Lightsabers are the coolest weapons in the entire world, and they chose to not show a single lightsaber in the entire series? (so far). That's just crazy.

Anyway, the series is cool, but I don't get why it's only 25-28minute episodes? An hour format for this kind of series would have been much better.

All-in-all, it's a good series. It's not your typical Star Wars experience, where there's tonnes of space battles and tonnes of 'wooom wooom' sounds. This series in fact has NO space battles and NO 'wooom wooom' sounds, so it might not be what the average Star Wars fan is used to. I'll keep an eye on this series, and I MIGHT bump my score up to a 9, depending on the quality of the series as the season goes on (or I might knock it down to a 7 if they keep neglecting the lightsabers).

Um who's brilliant idea was this?
lindellsmithjr6 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Harken back to the day that George Lucas wanted to make a space opera, and start his own empire. They laughed, and history was made. He single handedly rewrote the book on how to make movies (and money). George Lucas gave us a modern day space opera. Jones Favreau gives us a futuristic Spaghetti Western. I am not going to sit here and pick the show apart on canon. Because we all know that the canon is so diverse and can be confusing. What am going to do is say that this show does the long controversial Disney/Lucas/Prequel (Star Wars) justice. Keeping the story clean, minimal dialogue, and action in the right places. They acting is superb, you can see the expressions on the Mandalorians face even though he has a helmet on. The music is not symphonic but brooding and dark, much like the westerns of yore. I mean who thought hey let's have the baddest bounty hunter in this parsec grow a heart for Baby Yoda. Then deliver us a baby yoda that you freaking can't help but to love. Jon you sneaky sneaky. Listen whether you just like the original trilogy or love everything thing the Star Wars machine churns out. This show promises to get you to appreciate why you originally loved Star Wars. As a die hard fan of the originals. I thought I carefully selected my contenders for the movie. This show turns my once crafted world upside down. Damn you Jon!!!! Disney executives you need to pay attention. This is how you do fans right.

It's Star Wars
dracsharp13 November 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The first episode was perfect, taking the time to show the main character in a true Star Wars universe, it's rare to see such dedication to proper character development.

The Mandalorian is a smart and capable protagonist with strong principles. He is certainly not above learning and needing help and working together. I especially liked the scenes when he had to learn how to ride, and him giving up then trying it again with patience.

Good life lessons are plus especially for younger audiences, but most importantly it makes the show realistic and rewarding.

I'm getting really good vibes here!!!
eivindp13 November 2019
It was a surprisingly short pilot. However, the development of the character is done in a very clever and efficient manner. I'm happy to say that after having watched this episode, it was very clear to me that this is a character driven story and I feel this is what some of the newer Star Wars movies have been missing. Before watching the pilot I watched the three original Star Wars movies and what I really love about this show so far, is the fact that they're able to catch some of that atmosphere and nostalgia that you remember from the Original Star Wars Movies. At the same time, it's fresh, beautifully shot and really leaves you wanting to know more about this Bounty Hunter underworld that they're exploring.

Can't rate this highly enough!
mdkooter12 November 2019
Like seeing some of my favourite youth sci fi books brought to life.. (Jack Vance's Tschai comes to mind, or some of the more humerous Eric Frank Russel titles). The mandalorian feels like a more real, less child-oriented less commercial Star Wars. I especially liked the way many scenes seem visually and sequentially inspired by 90's sci fi comic books ( Storm by Don Lawrence comes to mind ). This further adds layers of immersion to the series. The plot is not (yet) particularly complicated but I think that is the virtue of the first episode : Just a crazy, normal week in the life of a future bounty hunter. Can't wait to see the rest of this, it has absolutely made my year after all the recent 'PG rated', millenial-oriented or marvel-scifi movies and series.

The Meh' Dalorian
steven-brown48730 December 2019
Am I missing something or has expectation for something decent from Disney SW hit such lows that we'll praise anything that's not the recent movies?

This is boring. It looks fantastic, but the plots are risible. We've ended the season without progressing from episode 1. Plot arcs unanswered, he's the worst bounty hunter in the Galaxy I mean, he gets double crossed and beaten up every episode, the scripting is poor too.

Bill Burr was brilliant but he always is, as was Gina Carano and Carl Weathers, Mando himself is one note.

Star Wars is moribund, Rebels was good but that got up its own towards the end, the last two movies can crawl in a Sarlaac pit and die. I had high hopes for this but it never got me going. Not terrible just very, very boring.

tylercortland-684253 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
There are way too many characters in this TV series. Not only do we have to keep up with the life experiences of those on a single planet, we have the impossible task of keeping up with an entire universe. I haven't the slightest clue on who the mandalorian is, and I have been watching for 6 hours. The producers have also made the idiotic choice of not including the best characters in Star Wars. Where is Darth Vader?Where is Luke Skywalker? Where is full grown Yoda? THIS SHOW SUCKS

theknownames5 February 2020
I am just so grateful for this series ever since seeing boba during the Christmas special I have wanted to learn more about this armor and all things mandalorian. It's been over 30 years and my patience has been rewarded generously! I enjoy the rewatches it is rich with the star wars universe. Super bonus to possibly learn more about Yoda's home world and force capabilities!

Ps rant don't bother, but I must ,thank you I am so relieved that people aren't complaining and wiping out its future like they did to terminator salvation and watchmen -all I ever wanted was to visit John Conners time and they finally do it and people complain it right back to the present. same thing with watchmen , getting all bent episode one and never even giving it a chance IMO-if it wasn't titled watchmen those same reviewers would have been so onboard. Film makers need encouragement too especially if their on the right track There was such hope and now it's gone , complained away by people who probably weren't even there to have their lives saved by these stories in the first place-the world was no joke back then. Okay now breathe - end rant

Best-in-Class Fantasy Sci-fi
yettygutschow2 February 2020
Overall story A+, special effects A, acting and scenes A+, emotional involvement and development of characters A+, standing by the original Star Wars themes A+. I've seen some reviews that say this series is boring. However, a really good series takes time and care to develop the story and develop the characters so we can have a solid attachment to both. That's what all of the other Star Wars movies (other than the original 3 and possibly Rouge One) have failed to do. Some of it is silly...but it fits in and compliments with the serious overtones of the overall story. I'm enthralled with every scene...I take in every word...because it's all done so well and so true to the original feel of Star Wars.

Surprisingly good
yewledurvank27 January 2020
After the recent flops in Star Wars universe, this was a very welcome surprise! The mandalorian is not a series that will keep at edge of seat; but rather ignited a slow disturbing curiosity - what will happen next? What shall the mandalorian do? Disney has taken a less known character, amplified its charisma by 100x - and it worked because not one had any idea of its potential

Fantastic work in terms of screenplay, graphics, storyline and most importantly direction - must watch

Baby Yoda and Disney
DLochner26 January 2020
It feels like Star Wars in the early stages of George Lucas. The look and feel is handmade - at least they make it look like this. The story is simple and straight, almost oldschool. No blood, not too much pain, not too much heart.

But all this makes the Mandalorian more Star Wars then the last episodes of the main Saga. The hero follows in every episode a problem target, finds a solution and switchs to the next episode.

All in all nice entertainment, with Baby Yoda as an eye Catcher for the big Disney Audience.

Nostalgic Star Wars
yuiusako22 January 2020
This feels like the Star Wars I wish had continued from the vintage Star Wars trilogy in every movie since. Great feels, good characters, great throw backs. The reason I gave it an 8 is I'm enjoying the short episodes and the nostalgic Star Wars atmosphere with a good main character and adorable baby Yoda. The reasons I hold back a 9 or 10 is that there isnt actually a main quest to the main character, they are just mini quests he faces, I am starting to think that's what this series is, it's more of a day in the life of a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe. I'm hoping for more depth in plot.

The Mandalorian captures the essence of the Star Wars universe immensely Well. While completely rethinking the way you perceive characters, it still manages to stay inside the boundaries. The spaghetti western style, in which the series is captured, captivates the viewer in a suspense, you only see in the old movies. The end of every episode makes you hungry for more, and the end of the season climaxes into a spectacular orgy of old Mandalorian lore. Season 2 is greatly anticipated!

The best in Star Wars Universe
isadoura20 January 2020
Great show. But it's a little predictable the solutions ways and sometimes the characters made some decisions just for the plot walks on whatever the creators/writers want to. Baby Yoda is lovely and Mando is a good character indeed.

This is starting to feel like Star Wars again!
sean-hofs19 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
Just like many of other fans I started to lose faith in Star Wars ever since Disney took control. I am a big Disney fan, but I really disliked most of the things they have made so far. Except for Rogue One that gave me a little of the original 'SW vibes' that I'm looking for as a fan.

I was afraid The Mandalorian would gave me the same dissappointment as episode 7,8 and 9. Although I don't like all what I see, I noticed that there was more of a Star Wars feeling in it than expected. The story in my opinion can use some approvement. Sometimes it felt a little to sweet (but hey, we still deal with Disney) and some things just felt a little off. "This is the way" made me think of some old school Power Ranger style, Baby Yoda feels a bit too much and the music (most of the time) doesn't give me the authentic SW feeling.

Most of the settings in the serie however do feel pretty authentic. I loved how they brought back all sorts of species like Jawa's, Tusken Raiders, Twil-lek and even Zabrak. Also the locations, like back on Tatooine felt pretty good. I love the concept art after every episode too. The way of filming and how they switch to different scenes are great as wel.

This gives hope. I can imagine that this style can interest both the older and the younger generations of SW fans. If they start making movies in this kind of style, I'd say there is still hope to expand the Universe in a satisfying way.

Made me a "Star Wars" fan... again
seraph724-218 January 2020
I adored "Star Wars" when I was little. But somewhere along the line, the magic dimmed for me. I enjoyed the new movies but it just wasn't the same. And then I started to see "Baby Yoda" all over the Internet and I was smitten. But I fully expected to find myself watching the show for the scenes of "The Child." Instead, I found myself really engaged in the world of Mando, Cara Dune, Greef Karga, Kuiil, IG-11, and, yes, the Child. Heck if I don't even get good and teared up at points! I can't wait to see what unfolds for Mando and his little womp rat in Season 2!

IN A STREAMING SERVICE FAR FAR AWAY.
steventonge17 January 2020
Brought you The Mandalorion, the closest thing to the starwars way since Rogue One! (before that Empire). Disney has gone some way to appease the fans for letting JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson get their grubby, ignorant, arrogant hands on the saga. We'll done to John Favreau, the force is strong with this one.

Read full lore, before make scenario!
aesgfdttrfdzsdef16 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
It's awesome western. It's bloody awesome "Star_Wars". But why mandalorian blacksmith calls Jedis an "enemies"?!!!! Mandalorians train clones for Republic + Jedi serves Republic = Mandalorians and Jedi just can't be enemies!

So I hope that being fixed in second season (or where Mando finds out more about Jedi). If it doesn't, it's gonna be less "Star_wars" canon, consequently not so awesome...

P.S.: don't say "you read full lore, newfag!". I know Mandalorians fights lots against Jedi. But (here's come CW7 spoilers {still canon}) Ashoka co-oparate wish DeathWatch. So I didn't say they Allies, I say they have too less reason to called enemies.

Enjoyable, but too politically correct
metalgear80016 January 2020
The first season started out great but quickly went to downhill. Why? You can definitely notice this is Disney. First they ruined Spider-Man, now Star Wars.

Hand to hand combat looks more like dancing and there are more female fighters than the average production. Disney clearly wants to avoid gender complaints but it achieves the opposite effect, or at least me for me. Not so musculair women are overpowering big men with ease and along with the dance-like fighting it becomes totally unbelievable and yes even ridiculous. In episode 4 Mando asks the villagers who's ever shot a gun before and before the eyes of many only a woman replies with "yes". Later in that same episode Cara Dune mindlessly heads across the battlefield ignoring all enemies except the AT-ST. How a "veteran" can be so impuslive, and still alive for that matter, is beyond me. I may come off as misogynist but I'm not. I don't dislike strong women but then portray ACTUAL strong women. Disney just fabricated a politically correct production for the typical America family and that's exactly the problem. My second point of criticism is the simply the lack of death (and perhaps some mild gore for the injures). Star Wars is no horror show but it's Star WARS. Not Star Hugs.

Don't get me wrong though. After each episode I wanted more. Even if that feeling get less over time because of aformentioned criticism. I guess one cannot expect more from Disney so all we can hope is for more of the same? I can imagine worse things. Let's just hope they cut the creed stuff like "this is the way". It makes me cringe every time.

First 2 episodes was very extracted, it didn't happen that much. But they didn't rushed it tho and that is a good thing. Baby yoda is so cute by the way! Mindblowing for how cute he is, everytime you look at its face:) <3 But at first I didn't knew the plots idea to be honest, i mean where they would wanna go with this storyline. So a questionable plot and story AT FIRST! But from the 3:rd episode it felt like it got better, and the last 2 episodes was epic! Bring us some more of the Mandalorian!

Best Star Wars production for decades
thadrewman11 January 2020
Jon Favreau has done an amazing job with this show.

This show has solid character development even with the droids which hasn't really been achieved since R2-D2. Each episode has a great mix of story, drama and action. I don't want to say much about the story but they really mix in some classic races/characters and landscapes with plenty of new and creative characters and landscapes as well.

The great thing which also sets it apart from a lot of other tv shows is that it doesn't rely on cliff hangers at the end of episodes like most streaming service shows are guilty of it is just a solid show that keeps you wanting more.

If this is the direction Disney wants for their shows i'm on board

Thank the maker! Thank you John favreau and Dave filoni! You nailed it.
njebaily10 January 2020
At a time when Disney execs were making a big money grab with no reverence for what made Star Wars special.

We have 2 writers/ directors who went back to the roots of what George Lucas and Joseph Campbell were trying to explain from an anthropological humanistic perspective.

This harkens back to the days of the Spartans in Ancient Greece. You have a warrior culture hunter who has identified an addition to his culture. He is growing as a warrior with the help of a mentor, and there are lessons along the way.

This is why Star Wars has a special place in our hearts. It connects on a level we can't explain, it's at the core of what it means to go on a hero's journey as a human. We all have to go on this journey on some level.

I'm so thankful these guys fell into Disney's lap. I only wish Disney had paid more attention to the reasons why we are so enamored with the mandalorian series (and the original saga by George Lucas) when they decided to write episode 7-9 which are pretty much straight garbage. JJ may have had the start of a great story with episode 7 but we'll never know after what rian Johnson pulled. Until Disney understand that light sabers, space fights, laser guns, are not what makes Star Wars great, it's the story, story writing, characters and character development that just happens to exist in outer space that we all connect with that is so important.

Oh GOD THANK YOU JON FAVREAU FOR BLESSING US WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF WORK! Sending all of my regards for you.

This is honestly a breath of fresh air after I got soooo disappointed by Episode 9, also this is my second favorite Disney Star Wars (after Rogue One). The storyline is so neat and well-written, the pace isn't rushed at all. Kudos for all of the versatile actors, especially Pedro Pascal! Gosh I love this man so much. Even with his helm on, he can express his emotions very well through his body language. He always nailed it. Overall this series is very entertaining and I can't wait for the next season! Hopefully I won't wait too long, I miss baby yoda already!

Star Wars Is Back Baby!
TheHoodOfSwords8 January 2020
I saw trailers for this, and then I watched 2/3's of it thought it was amazing! I then went away and saw some of the other Star Wars movies including the rise of Skywalker. I came back to this and just... wow. This is what Star Wars should be! Fun, action filled and with cool battles. The Mandalorian as a protagonist is amazing. Pedro Pascal does a great job. The Mandalorian is a must watch for any fan of Sci-Fi!

A Well-Done Show!
dmace-557484 January 2020
Warning: Spoilers
*MY 1ST TV SERIES REVIEW ON IMDb*

I've recently finished the 1st Season of "The Mandalorian" on Disney+, & it was great. All of the characters have been portrayed very well. My favorite character in the series is Baby Yoda. He's without a doubt the cutest character throughout the show.

In the last episode of Season 1, a lot of surprising events have happened, & some of them are...

1. The Mandalorian's real name revealed.

2. A character had died.

3. The Darksaber was onto the hands of an evil Mandalorian now.

Other than that, every minute of this show is well-done. The events are great, & the music is good.

When Season 2 arrives, I'll update my review for this show!!

Glorious Bounty Hunter
dylanrenner44 January 2020
Having seen the commercials and trailers for this series on Disney+, I just had to watch it. In the beginning, the series wasn't very clear, there was a lot of confusion as to what was going on and more. It seemed like every episode had its own story and it's own background and it all ended with the same result. Mando and the Child flying off in space defeating a challenge and bonding in a small way. Noticing this was my only complaint with the show, the problem is that the series is interesting enough and fun to watch, but if you know the ending to each episode, then why would you need to watch it? Nevertheless, the series was very interesting, it always came with puzzling new finds and the character development was also great to view throughout the series. Jon Favorea did a great job creating and directing the series and it was fun to watch. It was also entertaining to watch throughout the series with that Star Wars aspect, its also a cool idea to view that bounty hunter life in Star Wars. It'll be interesting what the second season has in store.

Better than expected
changyueyu31 December 2019
Just finished watching episode 8.

The show started great, but last 2 concluding episodes felt rushed. Also, Mando & baby Yoda's exile part is only 3 episodes (4-6), which is incredibly short because judging from dialogue, they've traveled together for at least couple years. The finale is laid out nicely to continue on next season (or movie) but there's little too much reveals on the end and many of these reveals didn't feel impactful enough to make impression.

Still, it feels like Star Wars and story makes logical sense despite being little bland, which is more than what I ask for Disney's Star Wars these days (unlike The Rise of Skywalker).

Great first season!
Brad_G3531 December 2019
The first season just ended and it was great. There was one episode I didn't like but overall, the series makes me even more interested in Star Wars. Give us stories like this all over the galaxy.

I loved season 1 but there's definitely a formula there that I hope they can switch up for season 2 to keep things interesting.

With Disney bringing this out on a weekly basis, it's something Netflix does with some of their shows but this is the first streaming show I've been excited for weekly. I really hope this can be the new standard with TV and Movies. Just let me subscribe and watch on release day. For big movies, just let me pay to watch at home on release day.

I'm a bit unorthodox with my ordering of favorite Star Wars movies but I would put this up there with the best Star Wars.

We must have a Mandalorian vs Jedi movie & Boba Fett series.
vandermcleod-0363230 December 2019
Was that Boba? Sure it went through many of your minds too haha.

Same creators pretty please if you make them. I "was" a die-hard Trekkie; now, I'm a Mandalorian.

I loved, just like most, the original trilogy, then well, you know the rest. This is the way, yes, the way Star Wars should be. Loved the Storm Troopers, was always an Imperial supporter for SW in the past.

Good stuff.

faridalvarez-130 December 2019
Disney is doing millions with new "Star Wars" (notice the quotes), this means nothing about doing the right thing, not all is only about money. I'm not an expert in movie-making but I'm a true Star Wars fan, so I know that if they want something that endures, something that make the fans watch it again and again, they should throw all previous crap (I bet nobody will missing it, not me) after Return of the Jedi and do it all again with Jon Favreau and his team...I mean, just do all what he said, he is a TRUE fan that understand how is Star Wars.

This show is excelent and can't wait for the second season!!!

goldenrazr30 December 2019
They just threw some crappy Gina Carano in there because women power. Way to kill the tense and epic vibes Disney. Other than episodes 4,7, and 8 everything is literally perfect :))) Therefore 5 out of 8 episodes were perfect. Rated 12/30/2019, there are currently 8 episodes out. Great job on everything else though. Really perfect. Actually making it 7 stars now just because its so good. Feminism stuff is really annoying though.

Slow start to a really great Star Wars show
hawkencort29 December 2019
I, like many other Star Wars fans, got really excited when this show was announced. I signed up for Disney+ for other reasons but this show clearly had my attention when I started it on release date.

I will admit that this series is slow to start off with and little to no character development is made until later in the show. The main thing that kept me watching was to see how it would end up. To my surprise it ended up very well and I am excited for season 2 whenever that may be.

I am glad that they had a clear view as to what this show would be and didn't give the directors to have creative freedom as much as they did with the Star Wars Sequels. I really enjoyed some episodes and others were just filler which is pretty normal with TV shows.

The Visuals, Writing, Acting, Sound, and pretty much everything was top notch and hard to come up with negatives on this show. I still wouldn't say it is perfect but I would say it is exciting and I am ready to see what is next in the future of this show.

Absolutely Nailed it for me.
lostmedals29 December 2019
I've just finished watchig all 8 episodes and loved it. My rating is based on how it made me feel, Like an 8 year old just seeing Star Wars for the first time again.

I see a lot of low ratings, based on this not being adult or grown up enough. I think you've got to realise that this is a Kids show on a Kids Channel. It's not mean't to be a serious piece of Film Noir or a hard hitting Drama. It's escapism.

Yes the episodes are short, But they're supposed to be. I felt it was supposed to be like those old western saturday morning shows, Short, Dramatic, not too serious and with a cliffhanger, and they nailed it in my opinion.

I'm looking forward to series 2.

A decent season one
samuelsquires28 December 2019
If there is one thing I know about Disney, it's that seasons 2+ are usually exponentially better than season one. With a lot of episodes not focusing on the main plot such as episode six, some parts of the show disappoint me. However the season greatly makes up for it with its first two and last two episodes, which do a great job storytelling wise, and a fair job with things like dialogue and cinematography. Despite its typical "Disney season 1" flaws, It already beats out almost every other Star Wars tv show, (other than Clone Wars). It promises a bright and interesting future.

This is the Way! The fans have spoken
Kleanthis_Xanthopoulos27 December 2019
STORY (8/10)

The Mandalorian's story is simple, and that is a good thing. I have had it with all those super complicated and ultimately nonsensical stories that are trying to surprise the viewers literally in the end of every episode! On top of that, the story feels "Star Wars" in a way that we have not had since "Return of the Jedi".

The story isn't perfect though. In the middle episodes there is a small pacing problem and at times we have some cliches that we could have done without (especially episode 4), but their negative effects are negligible. Lastly the exposition, in terms of characters, political status of the galaxy and the show's main story, is great, although not perfect.

I suppose everyone by now knows who is carrying the show but I will leave this review completely spoiler free. Regardless to say that, I had my doubts in regards to specific story-wise elements at the first episode, but fortunately the show delivered.

ACTING (9/10)

Acting goes from average to great, depending the actor/actress and the character. Most actors/actresses do not have challenging material to work with, since the show focuses at the titular Mandalorian. There are a few exceptions from episode to episode, but nothing extra-ordinary.

Those who have more challenging material to work with are those who have to voice the droids and Pedro Pascal. An actor's job is to relay feelings and thoughts through the dialogue they have been given. In order to do that they use three tools; a) their voice and its tones, b) facial expressions, c) the mannerisms of their body.

Voice actors in general, by definition, can use only their voice. In the case of portraying something like a droid that becomes even more difficult since the actor's voice is changed somewhat (in the case of droids becoming more mechanical). In that regard, Taika Waititi as IG-11 and Nick Nolte as Kuiil, deliver an incredible performance.

Additionally, Pedro Pascal has a very difficult job to do. He can use only his voice and his body mannerisms. Even more so, through the helmet he is always wearing and changes his voice, using his voice to relay thoughts and feelings is a feat on its own. Although he wasn't given the most challenging material dramatically, Pedro Pascal is commendable because he managed to act and deliver under these difficult circumstances. As such, I hereby nominate him for multiple awards. I have spoken.

DIRECTING (7/10)

Directing wise the show is OK/average. The directors manage to guide their actors but overall the show does not require the skills of a grand director.

At least the directors do not make cliche mistakes like the ever rotating camera that we are seeing nowadays to many good and bad shows.

The directors seem to know what they are doing, they just weren't given something difficult and demanding to test them.

PRODUCTION (9/10)

The production excels at delivering the world of Star Wars. Forget the prequels, forget the sequels. "The Mandalorian" is the original trilogy's spiritual child.

The only thing that I will complain about the production is that most episodes are ~30 minutes long and as such, "sub-par" in regards to industry's standards. Hopefully next season we will be getting "normal" episodes in length (~45 minutes) or maybe even longer. Regardless if they need to keep them short in order to maintain quality, I won't complain....much.

SUMMARY EXECUTION (8.25/10)

The Mandalorian is a good show that has pleased Star Wars fans and sci--fi fans alike. It has even pleased me, and I am not a particular Star Wars fan and on top of that I am a hard man to please.

Although not the most mind-blowing series and not the next GoT or anything like that, it is a series that delivers at throwing you back into the Star Wars universe, something we did not have since "Return of the Jedi".

Lastly the show delivers on all accounts (story, directing, acting, production).

A must see for all Star Wars fans and sci-fi fans out there.

A great show with a weak final episode
alkor-8642527 December 2019
I've had so much fun with this show and I'm so grateful to everyone involved for making it happen. I love the music, the characters, the spirit of adventure, the atmosphere of the Wild West with some space magic sprinkled in... Of course it's silly at times, this is Star Wars, what else did you expect? Silliness is part of the charm!

Now let's talk about reasons to give this show a try, even if you, like me, aren't a SW fan. This is a story about an outwardly stoic warrior who shows us his human side piece by piece, until eventually you can't help but root for him, and a small child with potentially destructive powers who's still figuring out this world he's been born to. Does that sound like an interesting dynamic to explore? That's because it is. And if the relationships between the characters aren't enough, there's also the action which is underlined by a beautiful score.

The Mandalorian certainly has its flaws, but to me personally, it's been a lifeline during these difficult times.

This Is How Star Wars Things Should Be!
MovieBuff1173227 December 2019
The Mandalorian is about Mando taking baby Yoda from the imperials because he thinks they will do something bad to him. Many people come after baby Yoda and they have to keep him in one piece.

The Mandalorian was a great show. It was always exciting to wait for the episodes to come out weekly instead of having them all come out on the same day. I thought that was a great choice by Disney. They did that with all of there other shows. I didn't anticipate them as much as this show but it is still a good idea. This show I have to say felt like an original movie. I don't know how or why but it just did. The only episode that didn't was the fourth. That one felt like the new movies. Besides that, I loved watching all of the episodes. I found some cheesy dialogue here and there. Those were lines they would say in a show like Star Wars Rebels or something like that. Which Dave Filoni also did that show so I understand were he came from with that but sometimes it was annoying to hear that cheesy dialogue. The action scenes were spot on. I loved all of them. They were all pretty intense and contained some pretty solid fight scenes that I found cool to watch. The one I really like had to be the opening to the first episode. That was a great introduction for The Mandalorian. The score to go along with it really made it something. The effects also didn't look to bad for a TV show. There was a scene were a Jawa fell off of the thing and just disappeared once he hit the ground. That was the only mistake I could find. It was just a good and exciting TV show.

Overall, The Mandalorian was a fun and action packed adventure I would definitely recommend. It is the Star Wars adventure you probably have been watching.

Doesn't feel like Star Wars
flamingtwig27 December 2019
Warning: Spoilers
Honestly, just a bunch of random characters with "Star Wars" slapped on the title. Baby Yoda is outright abused to change the course of events, the course of events are already really stupid. Most of the time there isn't an underlying attempt to tie all the narratives together; resulting in a few mid-season episodes feeling completely disconnected from the main plot.

Just watch the writing in the last episode, its absolute crap.

Other people's reviews... "This is actually Star Wars" false. i cant be bothered to explore how dumb this is. Star Wars is about an evil sith lord corrupting an already weakened republic and jedi order and its about a special jedi knight who was corrupted by this dark power but who eventually, with the aid of his children, was turned back to the light and overthrew the dark lord.

The vibe is right? its boring

Space western
comradeandrej27 December 2019
This is what Star Wars was supposed to be if there were no samurai (jedi and sith), a space western. If they do not spoil it later on with some story too complex with a bunch of plot twists and all the "in stuff", it will remain a great show. To be honest I would be enjoying it even if Mando was only going around and collecting bounties. The vast space, different races and cultures, all that mixed with western-like space bounty hunter life is enough to keep me pinned to my couch wishing for an ever bigger tv screen.

This IS StarWars
swiffer-3943021 December 2019
The Speedster shot,oh Mother. I'am in love with it,wearing a headset,lights off,Treble maximum and chilling this too short! scene,over and over.

Since Episode 7 I will say, this IS real StarWars at its best. I believe Baby Yoda will become Baby Judas...seems to be so.

Where is MY Baby Yoda?

Scot_Rutherford20 December 2019
I'm liking John Favreau's writing. Predictable here and there but the cast more than makes up for it. Great Space Opera from the best original space opera franchise. I might go to 9/10 as they go further.

I still hope season 2 will be better
clement46219 December 2019
The first couple of episodes are alright, but you can quickly feel that the story is going nowhere. There is no emotional implication whatsoever, no suspense, no character development. This first season was just extremely boring. Maybe that was part of the vibe they wanted to imprint, maybe the story will develop in the next seasons, I keep my hopes up, but I've been let down by Star Wars so many times lately that I'm getting afraid to hope for it to get better...

Overrated a bit
krispity31119 December 2019
So this show apparently gets a 9, meanwhile watchman gets slightly above a 7...hmmm. I have nothing against this show, but people are over hyping this beyond belief. I love how all these millennials think this is "so Star Wars." This is nothing like Star Wars, but it doesn't have to be in order to be good. People are just delusional, and most of the people claiming that this is so Star Wars weren't even born when the original trilogy was out and can't simply relate. Everything from the score, to the action choreography, to the characters, have literally nothing to do with Star Wars. But that's the Disney goal, right? Why would they want to pay royalties to Mr. Lucas after they basically bought everything from him. Their goal was to simply kill all the characters we love, and create new ones so that they can make all the money and pay nothing out to the original creator. Simply put, it's all business from them.

About the show, there is no central plot whatsoever. All 6 episodes that I have seen have been nothing but filler episodes, full of side missions with no central theme or purpose. It's literally impossible to be emotionally invested in anything. I'm not even sure people would care that much if the Mandalorian died, besides the fact that it would end the show. I find this to be ironic because people had a hissy fit with Watchmen after one episode and they decided to prematurely give it a horrible rating. However, most intelligent people that watched the whole season can contest that it was one of the greatest TV shows ever made. Meanwhile, I can't help but think that Disney is just fooling us with this whole live streaming thing. Every streaming service puts out a whole season and leaves it to the customer to binge it, or not, since filming is technically over. However, Disney decides to put out one episode a week so that we can continue our paying subscription, even though they can just give us the whole season at once. The reason why is that they have no faith in their product, and they know that they are just giving us filler episodes that are essentially trash. If they put out the whole season, we all know some would binge within a day or two, ultimately being disappointed and that can hurt their product through "the grapevine." Smart, but slimy. I'm almost a 100% certain that they are milking us pretty good with subpar writing, no main plot, but a bunch of fancy bells and whistles to keep the circle jerk fans around. At this pace, I can see them going for 10 seasons.

Nonetheless, I want to mention the good things. Costumes, cinematography, camera work, all pretty high production value. Unfortunately there is no meat and potatoes. As for baby Yoda, talk about a merchandise cash grab. He has been a useless pet for 6 episodes now. You would think the plot would revolve around him by now, but like I said they are milking our wallets. I'm happy to give my money in the namesake of quality, this isn't it. 2019 has been a blessing for TV. Go watch Mr. Robot and Watchmen

Classic Star Wars feel with a modern budget
Takasagi16 December 2019
I've been rewatching all the Star Wars movies to prepare for Rise of Skywalker. When I rewatched Rogue One, I thought it was different. It didn't feel like Star Wars. It felt grittier and updated. It was really cool to see classic stormtroopers with a modern budget. This show captures that perfectly. I've been so invested in the story so far and I can't wait for the next episode. The part of the show I'm least interested is actually baby Yoda. Compared to everything else happening in the show I just can't bother to care about him. And I'm not a fan of the music as well. It isn't bad, but compared to the John Williams score I'm used to with Star Wars it just can't compete. Even with these minor nitpicks I have, I still enjoy the show very much.

Finally figured out the series
jwack-6274113 December 2019
First off I love the show, but there hasn't seemed to be a central storyline past the first couple of episodes. Everything since has been a series of one off adventures, The Mandalorian is basically a modern scifi remake of BJ and the Bear but instead of a man and a chimp traveling the country getting into adventures it's a mando and his baby Yoda

Good start, too much waiting.
orszakconnor13 December 2019
The Mandalorian has a very strong start. Chapter 1 - 3 do a great job of establishing the characters, story and the stakes. However Chapter 4 - 6 feel more like side missions in a video game rather than the main story. I wish they had stuck to focusing on a main story and it's most important elements rather than beat around the bush and make you wait. This show clearly doesn't need 8 episodes, it could've been done in 5 or 6, and that is really disappointing.

So this is how real Star Wars dies...with thunderous applause
hakimull12 December 2019
The main thought that comes to my mind when watching this show: wtf? I'm sorry, it may have been rude, but...then I look at the ratings of film critics and the ratings of sites like this: double wtf? PEOPLE, ARE YOU CRAZY? In my memory, this is the most overrated product ever. Honestly, I'm not going to hurt or humiliate anyone right now, no, but my fan feelings are seriously hurt. I don't understand why everybody drool over this show.

You know, there is a saying: In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king. I think, after being disappointed in the recent SW movies, people are glad to have something that reminds them of that real SW feeling. I think fans see familiar symbols and shout: "oh my God, it's 10 out of 10!!11!" In my opinion, this is an indicator of incompetence both in the understanding of cinema and in the understanding of SW universe.

I'm not demonizing a Mandolorian, IT'S NOT BAD SHOW FOR KIDS! But it is a shame to evaluate it so hight. When in the top next to the outstanding works of cinema it turns out THIS, it becomes uneasy for me. Mandalorian not even a real movie. It's just a bunch of fan content with primitive characters and dialogue, it's no sane storyline, poor graphics and expressionless acting. It's just a collection of objects everyone loves, but it's not a valuable work of art. Here is another brazen way to make money. And Disney succeed in it. But why would I look at someone just making money by offering me something so primitive? No, i wouldn't.

Wonderful by the moment
carlosvelasco696 December 2019
This serie is great because many reasons.

The quality in the images is so beautiful, the transitions between scenes is really Star Wars. The music is all the time with you making every moment more easy to understand as well the blur effects. Every important moment has the character or the lanscape focused to see what the camera wants to. Special effects really nice too.

So in a few words: Very good serie. By the moment. The fifth is goings worst, I expect the following will be better. I really like see how this anti-hero grows up and enjoy a good "film script" (story)

*Please Disney, take care of the details!, like the cloak/cape/capa. How many Mando has? It's indestructible? and doesn't get dirty?...

KenzoMagaro6 December 2019
These are really " TOP NOTCH " drama side story for STAR WARS.. overall progress storyline are " well - made " .. if only the story could made a little longer around 59 minutes or more would be nice.. but i know it's all about budgets.. no cons for STAR WARS movie and all its side story... all type of emotions fully compact in STAR WARS.. what I wanna said that " SAGA NEVER END ." its true :)

simonderekpearce4 December 2019
I'm pretty impressed with the series. They have incorporated some elements from the original films into a pretty good story. The humor works well unlike the TLJ and it actually feels like Star Wars which is something you cannot say about the current trilogy.

Wholesome and Cute
meltingmel30 November 2019
I have been really anti-Disney when it comes to their acquisition of Star Wars. None of their movies have been that great and I'm truly a Lucas fan through and through. But this show? This really takes me back and it is done really well! The best episode so far is Episode 4 and I was stoked to see that Bryce Dallas Howard directed it! She did the best job so far I think.

I'm definitely a fan and YES - one of my number one reasons?

Baby Yoda. Hands down the cutest little guy I have EVER seen. He has truly stolen the show and my heart.

Awesome job, Disney! I'm really happy with this!

jeaniusfive25 November 2019
Biased, sexist, and ignorant. The show is cool and the production values are high and the actors are good.....

Half the show features a man in a costume walking around and sitting in his chair LMAO. The plot so far is paper-thin and the pacing is kinda dull and underwhelming. But THIS is what everyone thinks has "saved" Star Wars?

Praise to Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson, and everyone else who's worked with them for creating films and stories that actually follow the myths and themes and metaphors George Lucas has bleed into this Saga from the get-go. The Mando is great, but better than the films is a lie being spewed by the crying man-baby brigade.

ssjsr23 November 2019
1st Episode was especially the last 15 mins. 2nd Episode was dull 3rd Episode was a comeback but seems to lack hood enough writing.

For me 8 Star Rating is legit and acceptable. Anything beyond it is fake and fandom led.

jwklein-6917922 November 2019
Just watched episode 3. I still think it's a good series with many options for the future. But why are the episodes so short? With the recap and the intro at the beginning and the end credits at the end, it takes less than 25 minutes. The story must now take shape, otherwise it won't work
