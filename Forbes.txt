The Mandalorian Season 1 Review

I’m a big fan of the new Star Wars trilogy, and of the two new stand-alone films—Rogue One and Solo—but my favorite new Star Wars since The Return of the Jedi isn’t something you’ll see in theaters.

The Mandalorian, Disney’s new live-action Star Wars TV show, debuted with the release of Disney+, the company’s new (and still pretty bad) streaming service. Its eight relatively short episodes mean that the total runtime for the first season is about two movies or so long.

This means that our helmeted protagonist, Mando, gets more screen-time than most Star Wars characters, and certainly more than Boba Fett—the bounty hunter that inspired all of this. And it’s just terrific.

The story takes place after The Return of the Jedi and the fall of the Empire, but still long before The Force Awakens and the rise of the First Order.

We’re in the no-man’s land between the two trilogies, once filled with Extended Universe books and lore, now left hollowed out after Disney acquired LucasFilm. Interestingly, The Mandalorian ties into the animated Clone Wars TV show in some big and surprising ways.

It also does an incredible job at capturing that special something that made the original trilogy so great. I think J.J. Abrams also does this, to some extent, in the new trilogy, but Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni do it better here, despite the lack of Skywalkers and Jedi—or perhaps because of it. They’re not working with a clean slate, exactly, but they’re able to tread new ground while still tipping their hats to what makes Star Wars feel like Star Wars.

Sometimes it’s in the nitty gritty, the small details that compose each scene, or the little references and in-jokes. We see Kowakian monkey-lizards on the planet Navarro, just like Jabba the Hutt’s pet, Salacious B. Crumb. One is being roasted on a spit while the other looks on, forlorn in its cage. No mad cackle here, not when you’re about to become someone’s dinner.

There are red-eyed Jawas, thuggish Twi’leks, and scout troopers who couldn’t hit a can with a blaster if they tried.

The remnants of the Empire are a disheveled bunch. Stormtroopers in dirty armor, slovenly and demoralized. There is almost no sign of the New Republic out here in the Outer Rim, the Wild West of a galaxy long, long ago and far, far away.

The Mandalorian is a Space Western for the most part. It’s a Sergio Leone homage, from the music to the motifs. It’s also an interesting blend of serial and procedural storytelling.

While there’s an overarching story that ties all the episodes together, about half of the first season unfolds more like a procedural drama, with self-contained adventures (or misadventures) playing out in each episode. It starts off as a serial, becomes a procedural, and then returns to the serial format for the final two episodes.

You don’t see this kind of thing very often these days. Most tent-pole dramas and even many comedies are serials these days which I’m largely okay with. I like big, elaborate stories that grow from episode to episode, season to season. But I like this show’s format, too.

It reminds me a bit of X-Files, actually. (Interestingly, The Witcher on Netflix does a similar thing since its first season is based on a book of short stories).

Indeed, the shifting format led to the season’s biggest backlash, as critics and fans found themselves wondering if the story would ever go anywhere, or if Mando would simply hop from one planet to the next, facing a new threat each week.

I actually really like the format, maybe because it reminds me so much of X-Files. In that show you’d have your Big Plot episodes all about the Cigarette Smoking Man and the conspiracy and the coverups and Mulder’s missing sister, but you’d also have your Monster Of The Week episodes, which were often my favorite.

What made it work so well was the fact that both formats were intertwined—unlike say, Law & Order, which is a procedural crime drama with no Big Story to tie it all together, or Game of Thrones which was strictly serial, with no Monster Of The Week episodes to give you a break from all that drama.

The Mandalorian

It’s a novel format and I’m glad the showrunners went that direction. It allowed us to visit cool new planets and revisit old ones, like Tatooine. And because this isn’t tied to the Skywalker Saga, we were able to see the universe from a wholly new perspective, and introduce cool new—and incredibly important—characters and revelations to the story of Star Wars more broadly.

I won’t spoil those for you. You can read my recap/reviews below for spoilers if you like. You’ve probably already been spoiled with regards to the series’ break-out star—a certain Child—and suffice to say that this character is perhaps the cutest, most adorable character on TV—period. For a show about a badass bounty hunter taking down all the roughest, meanest foes the galaxy can throw at him, this show sure is cute.

It’s actually a great juxtaposition—not quite a “buddy cop” story, but close enough. A bit like Logan, I suppose, with the rough-and-tumble Wolverine and his young ward, Laura.

The first season of The Mandalorian is an exciting, visually sumptuous adventure through the dirtier, less glorified corridors of the Star Wars universe. It captures the feel of Star Wars perfectly without ever having a lightsaber duel. And it leaves us with a galaxy full of opportunity for Season 2, with new planets to explore, new threats to face, and a new quest.

The Mandalorian

Beyond just the excellent storytelling and cinematography and special effects, the rest of the production is stellar. Pedro Pascal (and his stunt doubles) does an excellent job in the lead role as the titular Mandalorian.

He’s not one for words, and when he does speak it’s always a soft, Eastwood-esque growl. Not quite as growly as Henry Cavill’s Geralt in The Witcher, but in the same vein—the strong, silent type.

Mando is, if anything, less chatty. He also never takes off his helmet, so a great deal of emotion and reaction has to be conveyed without facial expressions. It’s quite remarkable.

The rest of the cast is also terrific. There are guest appearances (either in person or just as voices) from Nick Nolte, Taika Waititi (who also directs) and many others. Gina Carino as Cara Dune and Carl Weathers as Greef Karga are both fantastic in their respective roles. And Werner Herzog puts in an especially creepy performance as the mysterious Client.

The original score also deserves a great deal of praise. Composed by Black Panther composer Ludwig Göransson, I still have the theme song in my head. It captures both Star Wars and classic Western soundtracks perfectly. It’s so good that you never really need that famous Star Wars theme at all. It’s its very own thing, and works perfectly for the show.

Just listen:


I’m one of those rare Star Wars fans who likes the new trilogy as well as Rogue One and Solo. I like both The Last Jedi and The Rise Of Skywalker. I was thrilled when The Force Awakens came out. It’s funny, most Star Wars fans seem to like some of these but never all of them, but here I am—living proof that it’s possible!

I did not like the prequel movies, though there were bits and pieces of them that I enjoyed, and I think Ewan McGregor was perfect as Obi-Wan Kenobi and can’t wait for his show to come out on Disney+.

I still wish they’d remake the prequels entirely, however, though I know it won’t happen—and if they can’t release the original trilogy in its original format, I wish they’d change the “fixes” George Lucas made and put in modern CGI tweaks and practical effects instead of the super dated ones he added in one of the most absurd decisions a filmmaker has ever made. Truly, the changes to the OG trilogy are a disgrace.

But look at me now, getting all distracted. Going off on a tangent.

The Mandalorian

My point is that as a big fan of all the modern Star Wars films, I enjoyed The Mandalorian even more. More than Rogue One, more than the new Skywalker trilogy, more than Solo (which, by the way, is criminally underrated).

It’s a terrific show, and well worth a Disney+ subscription even if you cancel right after until Season 2 comes out (or some other show you want to stream). I’ve spoken with people who weren’t impressed, but all I can think is that they have terrible taste and useless opinions (just kidding . . . sort of). I loved just about every minute of the first season and I cannot wait—though I’m going to have to—for Season 2.

Not all episodes were as good and some were better than others—that’s just how it goes. I don’t expect to love every episode just as much. But there was such great variety from one to the next that I was always entertained.

Here’s a thing: I’ve watched each episode of this show more than once. Some I’ve watched four times. I’ve never done that (at least in short order like this) with any other show. I’ve rewatched shows but usually months or years later. Sometimes I’ll rewatch something because it’s a little confusing and I need to, but with this show I just want to. I could marathon the whole season again right now. That’s how much I love this show.

Score: 10/10 Lightsaber-Wielding Wookies Wasting Wampas

The Mandalorian Review
'The Mandalorian' gets off to an incredible start in its Season 1 premiere, bringing live-action ... [+] CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
Disney Plus is finally here, and as exciting as all those old vaulted movies may be, I’ve been most looking forward to The Mandalorian.

For the first time ever, Star Wars has a live-action TV show, and the Season 1 premiere did not disappoint. It’s a space western with some Firefly vibes and it feels very much in keeping with classic Star Wars.

The Mandalorian’s season premiere mostly takes place in seedy dives like the cantina from A New Hope or Jabba the Hutt’s palace from Return of the Jedi. This is a show about the darker underbelly of the Star Wars universe–the seedier, grittier Star Wars, with less of the good vs evil and more of shades of grey.

I’ll write some non-spoilery impressions out first, and then get into the recap/spoilery-review.

First things first, The Mandalorian’s opening foray is surprisingly short: Just 39 minutes. That’s three minutes shorter than your typical 1 hour TV spot after accounting for commercials. I’m not sure if the rest of the episodes will follow suite, or if they’ll have varied times. I suspect the latter since there’s no reason to have the same length episode on a streaming service like Disney+.

Today In: Innovation
39 minutes is short, but the premiere moves–for the most part–at a slow pace. Moments of action are largely cocooned between more plodding sections, though I never found any of it boring or overly slow. In fact, one of my biggest complaints with the Star Wars films these days is that they all move along much too quickly. The original trilogy was never shy about taking its time, and each of the first three films divided into roughly three locations.

In A New Hope we tarried for quite some time on Tatooine before another long segment on the Death Star, followed by a finale largely consisting of the assault on said Death Star. Minus a few brief scenes elsewhere, these were the only significant locations in the film.

In The Empire Strikes Back, the movie was divided between the opening segment on Hoth, Luke’s visit to Degobah and–after a short trip into a space worm’s gullet–Cloud City.

And in The Return Of The Jedi, Tatooine returns as our long opening location followed by a return to Degobah and then a long segment on Endor. Each film was largely broken up between three primary locations, with some of those locations revisited in the final film.

In virtually every Star Wars film since, we’ve hopped planets much too quickly. Even the mostly wonderful Rogue One zips between far too many locations.

And I suppose The Mandalorian has its fair share as well, but at least it allows for some slower moments, some visual world-building that brings us right back into the colorful, quirky and dangerous Star Wars universe. It’s filled with strange aliens and familiar creatures from the original trilogy. It feels very Star Wars from start to finish, and it doesn’t try to be much of anything else, while still offering up an intriguing and surprisingly important story.

Coupled with a lovely score from Black Panther composer Ludwig Göransson, The Mandalorian feels every bit the vintage Star Wars that we were hoping for, and I’m incredibly excited for Episode 2 which lands this Friday. That’s not very long to wait!

Here’s everything you need to know about Disney Plus.
The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
Okay, now on to the spoilers . . . .

A bounty hunter walks into a bar.
It’s a bar on an ice planet, but it’s not so different from the cantina that Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi found themselves in, just before meeting Han Solo. And the bounty hunter’s welcome is just about as pleasant.

Two seedy characters have a blue alien pinned to a table, and when the titular Mandalorian (Pedro Pescal) walks in, one of their drinks spills. This makes the bald-headed man angry, and he approaches our protagonist with blood in his eyes.

A fight ensues in which it’s firmly established just how much of a badass the titular Mandalorian is. He chops one of the aliens in half with the cantina door. Pretty violent for a TV-PG outing.

The blue alien (Horatio Sanz) thanks our hero, but his relief is short-lived. The Mandalorian puts a bounty puck down on the table and a holographic image of the alien pops up. He’s the mark, and soon he’s in the Mandalorian’s custody. They take a speeder out to his ship–it looks like it could be Luke’s from Episode IV, though much worse for wear.

They speed out to the bounty hunter’s ship, and when they get there, the driver tells them to stay off the ice. He drives off and moments later a giant dragon-like creature bursts through the ice and swallows up his speeder.

The dragon turns his attention to the Mandalorian’s ship and the two barely escape with their lives. The Bounty, as he’s officially described, is essentially the Mandalorian’s polar opposite. He never shuts up. He offers him money. He wanders around the ship, where he finds several other of the Mandalorian’s marks, all frozen in carbonite.

When he turns around, the bounty hunter is standing there. He puts him on ice, and the alien finally shuts up.

I’ll be honest, this opening segment was probably the weakest of the episode. It was comic relief before we needed comic relief, in a show that’s not really supposed to be funny. That’s exactly the kind of show you need comic relief in, but the relief part suggests it comes after some more serious segments. This came too soon.

Not to worry. The Mandalorian drops his cargo with this guy:

The Mandalorian
Carl Weathers as Greef Carga CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
This is Greef Carga, who’s in the business of giving out bounties to bounty hunters. He’s also in the business of stiffing them for their hard work, but at least he sets the Mandalorian up with a new–somewhat mysterious–job.

The Mandalorian heads out to meet his new client. He finds him in a room with four Stormtroopers–an odd set of bodyguards considering the Empire has fallen. Listed as simply The Client (Werner Herzog), he sets our hero off on a cryptic mission. They can’t give him a bounty puck or much information at all, beyond a tracker and the bounty’s age: He’s apparently 50 years old, and while they’d prefer him captured alive, proof of death will suffice.

So The Mandalorian sets out once again, making his way to the planet where the bounty is apparently hiding out. It’s a desert planet, and he’s almost immediately set upon by giant, hulking two-legged creatures called blurggs.

The Mandalorian
Nick Nolte as Kuill CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
He’s saved in the nick of time by Kuill (Nick Nolte) a familiar-looking alien who shows up riding one of the beasts, and then later teaches the Mandalorian to ride one. I really like Nolte’s character, though I doubt we’ll see him again. At least not any time soon.

Familiarity is one bell that keeps ringing throughout the episode, but not quite in the same way as The Force Awakens. That film copied the very large brushstrokes of A New Hope, and while I liked it a great deal it was undoubtedly taking nostalgia and familiarity a little far–especially with Starkiller Base.

In The Mandalorian, the familiar is more of an aesthetic. The titular character looks just like Boba Fett, thanks to them both hailing from the same “tribe” (a term we hear when The Mandalorian visits The Armorer (Emily Swallow) and planet of Mandalore. The Mandalorian is a foundling, however. I’m not sure whether Boba Fett was.

The Mandalorian
Emily Swallow as The Armorer CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
(Notice, many of these characters–just like the Mandalorian himself–are only referred to by their role or profession: The Client, The Bounty, The Armorer, etc.)

Familiarity extends to the world-building, with this very familiar little critter being cooked over a spit while another looks on from his cage:

The Mandalorian
The Dinner CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
But that’s the extent of The Mandalorian’s foray into nostalgia. This is a show that, at least after its season premiere, seems intent on doing something new, while tipping its helmet to what’s come before. Not only that, it promises to vastly expand the universe and what we know about Star Wars lore in ways that I think are, so far at least, enormously satisfying.

The Mandalorian and Kuill head out to where this mysterious bounty is holed up. He’s in some kind of compound in the middle of the desert, protected by a large faction of well-armed aliens. The whole “learn to ride” segment, followed by the two of them galloping out into the desert, sweeping orchestral horns blaring, is all distinctly Western. You can’t watch The Mandalorian any other way. Stylistically, this is a Western space opera.

The final gunfight is terrific, and feels like something out of The Magnificent Seven or The Sons Of Katie Elder. Just as the Mandalorian is devising his plan, a bounty droid shows up. This is IG-11 (Taika Waititi) and my only complaint is that he dies much too soon. Maybe he’ll be back at some point also. (It’s hard to say–so many of the actors on IMDB are only billed one episode, but that doesn’t mean they’ll only appear in one. It could just be that they’re keeping us on our toes.)

The Mandalorian
IG-11 bounty droid played by Taika Waititi CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
It’s not only a great action scene, it’s filled with great moments of comic relief–and this time, they’re well placed. IG-11 keeps threatening to self-destruct every time the odds seem against them. His protocol forbids him from being captured, and whenever things look too grim, he starts the self-destruct protocol.

The Mandalorian keeps hollering at him to stop from setting off his thermal detonator (which is another small fragment of familiarity–you may recall Leia’s similar threats in Return of the Jedi). It’s the first time we see our titular bounty hunter lose his cool, and it’s at once charming and funny.

In the end, the bounty hunters prevail, leaving a swath of bodies in their wake. Their target is beyond a heavy set of doors which they blast through. They come to a small, hovering sphere that turns out to be a cradle.

“Wait,” the Mandalorian says. “They said fifty years old.”

“Species age differently,” the droid replies. “Perhaps it could live many centuries. Sadly, we’ll never know.”

And this is when we see who the mysterious bounty is–and finally understand why no screeners were sent out to critics ahead of the November 12th launch of Disney+:

To avoid spoilers for a genuine “Oh my god!” moment.

Also: How cute is this???

The Mandalorian
A baby yoda!!! CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
IG-11 raises his blaster and we hear a shot go off, wince, see the droid fall to the floor with a blaster hole in the head. The Mandalorian, far from showing up to take out a mark, shows up just in time to save a baby Yoda.

Well, not Yoda, but a creature from the same species as the long-lived Jedi Master. We’ve only ever seen one of Yoda’s species, and I think they must be very rare–and very precious.

This is a pretty huge moment. Frankly, it’s one of the biggest, coolest moments in any of the new Star Wars films/shows. It’s kind of a big deal.

There’s a price on this baby’s head, and some factions associated with the fallen Empire want to capture it–perhaps, in the case of Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi) to research its inherent Force abilities–perhaps to harness them for the vestiges of the Empire.

Whatever the case, I think we’ve found our McGuffin.

I do believe that a moment like this is what so many people were waiting for, and never found, in The Last Jedi. Revelation and surprise and a connecting of dots. And I can see why so many people were upset when they didn’t get any of those things(even if I don’t agree with many of the complaints surrounding that movie).

This kind of epic reveal is exactly what has always made Star Wars such great fun. It’s a “Luke, I am your father” kind of moment (though perhaps not quite so earth-shattering) and I love it.

Verdict
The Mandalorian 
The Mandalorian CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
All told, I really enjoyed this episode. It’s a solid season premiere, introducing us to the Mandalorian and to the world(s) he inhabits, and sparking off a much bigger, more epic story than I ever expected from this show. We’re getting a rougher, wilder Star Wars in the bargain, much like Rogue One, and that makes me very happy.

Meanwhile, it’s every bit as big budget as the movies and, so far at least, boasts a more original plot. Whether that will hold up in the seven remaining episodes in Season 1 remains to be seen, but I have very high hopes.

I’ve heard some grumblings out there–because this is Star Wars so of course!–but I think The Mandalorian might end up being a mostly well-received TV show by both casual and super-fans and everyone in-between and along the margins, which is a nice change from all the controversy surrounding Star Wars lately. I’m pretty tired of the debate constantly buzzing about the peripheral of these films, which far too often dovetails into shouting matches about Mary Sues and SJWs, and I hope this show will remain focused on great storytelling and world-building, and the conversation around it will be about the content rather than the meta-politics.

Maybe I’m an optimist. I guess we’ll see. But so far, I’m absolutely loving The Mandalorian. It blends two of my favorite things–Star Wars and Western movies–into one incredible drama, and we’re only one episode deep. If the show continues to pick up steam and raise the stakes, I think we’re in for a real treat.

It was great. I have spoken.

What do you think? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook. And may the Force be with you!

The second episode of 'The Mandalorian' is filled with action and adorableness, proving that this ... [+] CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
Earlier this week, Disney+ launched and the first episode of the streaming service’s flagship program dropped.

The Mandalorian, it turned out, was truly excellent, capturing the classic Star Wars aesthetic and spirit without rehashing older stories, while also expanding the universe and lore in wildly unexpected ways. (Here’s my review for that episode).

At the end of Episode 1, we were shocked to discover that the target the Mandalorian (Pedro Pescal) is hunting down is actually a baby Yoda–a fifty-year-old toddler from the same mysterious species that Yoda hails from. It’s a great surprise–and surprising, in and of itself, that the big reveal was never spoiled beforehand.

In today’s episode, Mando–I’m calling him this from now on, thanks to Kuiil (Nick Nolte)–picks up where we left off, taking the baby back to his ship. Along the way he’s ambushed by more of the aliens he fought last week, but he dispatches them fairly quickly.

Today In: Innovation
The real obstacle to leaving the planet comes in yet another familiar form: Jawas. The little creatures who first took the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO hostage in A New Hope, and later sold them to Luke Skywalker and his uncle, are well into dismantling Mando’s ship by the time he returns.

I suppose this means we’re on Tatooine–Luke’s home world–which I suspected but wasn’t sure about until now. I don’t think Jawas drive around their fortress vehicles anywhere else. It certainly is a desert planet, and it would be fitting for Mando to find the baby Yoda there, of all places.

In any case, Mando blasts a few of the little buggers, but they escape into their massive sandcrawler and he’s forced to pursue on foot. The following action sequence is pretty great, with Mando doing his best to climb the treaded-fortress while the Jawas hurl junk at him, zap him and, in the end, blast him with about a dozen stun bursts at once. He topples all the way down to the ground far below.

Our hero sure can take a beating.

Baby Yoda

Mando and baby Yoda head back to Kuiil’s after this, and he offers to take the bounty hunter to trade with the Jawas–a plan that Mando doesn’t much care for given that they stole his stuff in the first place, but there’s not any other choice.

Baby Yoda, meanwhile, walks around and eats a frog-like creature and it’s all just far too cute. I can’t handle how adorable this little guy is. If nothing else, Jon Favreau deserves credit for creating the cutest Star Wars character since the Ewoks.

So off they go, and meet up with the Jawas who first demand Mando’s armor, then the baby, and finally say that they’ll give back the parts if he gets them “the egg.” Turns out the egg in question is located in a dark, menacing cave.

And this fun monster rhino is the mother:

The Mandalorian
Fearsome beastie! CREDIT: LUCASFILM / DISNEY
I’m pretty sure Mando spends as much time flat on his back on the dirt or in the mud as he does standing this episode. The alien rhino is fast and strong and Mando’s rifle jams up. He just barely scrapes by, and at once point has to use the floating cradle’s remote control to zip baby Yoda out of the creature’s path.

But it’s the baby who saves the day. We saw him earlier in the episode very nearly use the Force. When Mando is patching up his armor and tending to his wounds before the Jawa encounter, the baby keeps getting out of his cradle and coming up to Mando and raising his hand like he’s trying to heal him, but Mando keeps picking him up and putting him back.

This time, baby Yoda raises his hand and uses the Force to stop the beast in its tracks before lifting him up into the air. It’s an incredible show of power, though he can only hold it for a few moments before passing out from the effort. Still, it shows just how powerful this species must be with the Force, that even an infant can use it so adeptly.

Mando kills the rhino and retrieves the egg–which looks like it’s covered in mop strands–and brings it to the Jawas who quickly proceed to devour the yolk inside. Mando shakes his head in disgust.

He and Kuiil spend the night putting his ship back together and then say their farewells. I’m glad we got one more episode with Kuiil because he’s such a great new character and Nolte is just perfect in the role. I’m not sure we’ll see him again.

This was another terrific episode. It’s kind of crazy how much they fit into a measly 27 minutes, but somehow it didn’t feel too short. It felt just right. Just enough action, just enough adorableness, just enough suspense. The gorgeous original score sweeping over everything.

Director Rick Famuyiwa did a fantastic job following up the season premiere. This show really captures that old Star Wars magic perfectly, from the pacing to the humor to the look and feel of the old films. I’m so pleasantly surprised at how much I’m enjoying every minute of it. I watched the first episode three times and I suspect I will watch this one just as many. That really says something. There are very few TV shows I watch more than once–at least right away like this. The Mandalorian is one of a select few.

I’m really curious to see where this story goes and how baby Yoda ties into the larger story. I wonder if there will be any connection to the new films?

I also get the feeling that I’m going to be severely bummed out when this season is over. It’s only eight episodes and if they’re all short like this, well, that’s not nearly enough time to spend with such delightful characters!

What did you think of episode 2? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook. Episode 3 drops next Friday, the 22nd.

Good grief, The Mandalorian is just excellent. In Chapter 4, ‘Sanctuary’, everything great about the first three episodes gets even better.

For one thing, The Kid continues to be the most adorable thing that’s ever been on TV. The CGI and puppetry used to bring the baby Yoda to life is simply remarkable. Every little noise he makes is too cute. I can’t even handle it. Here, let’s look at another photo of him:

It’s an idyllic spot—steaming krill pools where the farmers harvest the little blue shrimp creatures surround pointy huts. It’s “in the middle of nowhere” and a perfect place to lay low.

Before they arrive at the village, Mando meets a soldier also on the run. Cara Dune (Gina Carano) is AWOL after fighting against the Empire in various military engagements, including Endor, before politics mucked everything up. “That’s not what I signed up for,” she tells Mando over a cup of bone broth.

Oh man, I wish I had a pic of The Kid drinking bone broth (which is very good for you, by the way). It’s his arrival with a cup of soup that breaks up the fight between Mando and Cara Dune. She thought he was after her and she can fight. Cara Dune is a serious badass, and the two of them are evenly matched. She still doesn’t want him around. His presence could bring heat down on her as well.

So Mando makes ready to leave and that’s when two villagers approach him with a job: Raiders have been pillaging their village and they have no way of defending themselves. We see this in the opening scene, when a mother and her child hide under a basket in a krill pond while alien marauders loot and pillage. It’s a great, tense moment.

Omera and her daughter CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
That’s Omera (Julia Jones), one of two great new female characters introduced into a show that’s been mostly men (other than the fascinating Armorer, of course). I want to learn more about Omera. Of her entire village, she’s the only one who raises her hand when Mando asks if anyone knows how to shoot a gun. Where did she come by this skill? I’m curious.

She’s also a potential romance for Mando, and very nearly takes his helmet off. The consequence of taking off a Mandalorian’s helmet in front of someone is essentially to be cut off from the tribe. “You can never put it back on,” Mando explains to Cara Dune. She laughs in response, and I paraphrase: “You mean you’d have to settle down with the hot widow and raise your kid here in peace?” How awful.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Before all that we got this:

The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian Battle CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
Mando doesn’t want to go help the villagers and they don’t enough money to pay him for a big job like fighting off marauders to begin with. But then they mention it’s in the middle of nowhere, and he decides that a remote farm is as good a hiding place as any.

Before they go, he enlists the help of Cara Dune and the two make their way to the village where all the kids run up and fawn over The Kid. And who can blame them? He’s just too stinkin’ cute.

The presence of children is another surprise here. There haven’t been many children in Star Wars films. Here and there—the padawans in the prequels; the slave children in The Last Jedi. But overall, even though kids love Star Wars, there just aren’t many kids in the movies. Having kids come and feed and play with Baby Yoda is a great touch.

In any case, Mando and Cara Dune head out to investigate the threat and find AT-ST tracks. They head back to the village and Mando says “You can’t live here anymore,” which is pretty hilarious. They chastise the farmers for not telling them about the AT-ST, which they did know about. But the farmers will not be moved.

The Mandalorian

What follows is a bit like The Magnificent Seven, though less tragic. Mando and Cara Dune help train the farmers with crude spears and blasters. They dig a trench and set a trap for the AT-ST to step into. They set up makeshift barricades.

Then Mando and Cara Dune head to the marauder encampment to provoke them into attacking the village. What follows is a pair of great action scenes. First, the pair of heroes gets into a brawl with their new enemies and blows up one of their buildings. They flee after the explosion and lure the marauders and the AT-ST back to the village.

The next part has some definite battle of Endor vibes, as the outgunned good guys fight back against the raiders and the AT-ST hangs back, refusing to fall into their trap. Some brave and nearly deadly heroics later, Cara Dune manages to lure the AT-ST forward and it steps right into the pit, toppling over. Mando sticks and explosive to it and boom . . . no more AT-ST. The raiders retreat, never to be seen again.

And for the next few weeks, Mando and Cara Dune and The Kid all live in peace and harmony with the farmers, and Omera and Mando grow closer to the point that she very nearly gets him to take off his helmet.

(On a side-note, we do find out that Mandalorians can take off their helmets in private to their heart’s content. So sleeping and eating and so-forth can all be handled without any awkwardness, as long as they’re alone. Mando does take off his helmet to eat this episode, but we do not get a glimpse of the man beneath.)

Mando tells Omera that he has to leave, but it would be best for The Kid to stay there with his friends. Omera agrees to raise him like one of her own.

That’s when the first bounty hunter shows up. We see him targeting baby Yoda with a sniper rifle. We hear a shot go off. It’s the second time someone pointed a gun at The Kid only to be gunned down before they could pull the trigger. The first time it was IG-11, the bounty hunter droid, who Mando blasted.

This time, Cara Dune sneaks up behind the bounty hunter and blasts him to a crisp before he can kill The Kid. Sadly, it’s too late for other reasons. Mando won’t be able to leave baby Yoda with his friends and Omera. It’s no longer safe. So they head out, saying farewell to Omera and Cara Dune, though I have a feeling it’s not the last we’re going to see of either character.

I’m absolutely in love with The Mandalorian. Pedro Pescal is simply phenomenal in the role, capturing so much emotion and tension, violence and tenderness, all without a single facial expression. It’s quite remarkable to watch.

And of course, baby Yoda is just wonderful. In this episode more than any other, he’s just constantly far too cute. There’s a scene a couple episodes back where he eats a frog whole, and he starts to in this episode but all the kids he’s with react with such dismay that he spits it back out. Too funny.

Both the two new female protagonists, Cara Dune and Omera, are great characters as well. Cara Dune is super tough and just radiates strength and physicality, but she has a fun, roguish personality. She’s almost like a spec ops swashbuckler. I really like her and hope she returns soon.

Meanwhile, Omera is mysterious and kind. She has a history I want to know more about, and while she doesn’t have the physical strength of Cara Dune, she seems every bit as strong and determined.

Each episode so far has been an adventure (or several adventures) but each has had its softer and more emotional moments as well. The show’s creators deserve huge credit for crafting such a well-balanced show, and doing so much with so little, especially when it comes to Mando, who is not a big talker, to put it mildly.

The Mandalorian

This episode was directed by Bryce Dallas Howard and she did a fantastic job. Like the rest of the episodes, it was written by the show’s creator, Jon Favreau, who deserves many more Star Wars projects as far as I’m concerned.

Maybe that trilogy that the fickle Game of Thrones creators were supposed to create before bailing for that sweet, sweet Netflix money, should go to Favreau. Or maybe he should just keep making more Mandalorian. Either way, he’s really captured the spirit of Star Wars down to the tiniest detail here, and I couldn’t be more pleased.

This is the way.

Mandalorian Chapter 5
In Chapter 5 of 'The Mandalorian' our heroes travel to a familiar 'Star Wars' planet and lots of fun ... [+] CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
The cantina from the very first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope, is under new management.

Long ago, when Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 walked into the cantina in Mos Eisley, the bartender hollered at the droids that their kind wasn’t welcome here. They were forced to wait outside while Luke and Obi-Wan tended to business.

Well times have changed, much to Mando’s chagrin. He’s not a fan of droids, but look who’s running things in the Mos Eisley cantina now:

This is just one of the many great bits of Star Wars fan-service that make up Chapter 5, ‘The Gunslinger.’ Some might think it’s too much fan-service, but I think it’s wonderful and I’m glad to see this show do so much in this regard, truly harnessing and anchoring us to the Star Wars universe and original trilogy without ever having to rehash old storylines (as in, we don’t have yet another damn Death Star).

The speeder bikes in the header image for this post are another bit of fan-service. They’re not identical to the ones from Return Of The Jedi’s Endor segment, but they’re pretty close. But really, just being back on Tatooine for the first time in 36 years is so great. The last time we were on Luke’s old planet (at least on the screen) was in the Jabba the Hutt segment in RotJ. That’s forever ago, and even though business seems slow at the cantina under new management, it’s good to be back.

Mando has just landed after a scrape with another bounty hunter in space. The hunter seems to have him dead to rights and says “I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold,” which pisses Mando off, so he does a tricky maneuver and blasts the other guy to kingdom come. “That’s my line,” he says.

He made it out alive, but the ship is leaking fuel and needs work ASAP—at one point Mando powers down and the Kid laughs in this really adorable baby way, clearly unaware of the precariousness of their situation—so Mando heads to the nearest planet. A desert planet. The voice on the radio identifies itself as Mos Eisley tower, and that’s when you know they’re in Tatooine.

Mando lands and immediately three mechanic droids rush over to start servicing his ship. Naturally, he shoots at their feet, causing them to scuttle away in fear.

The exchange anger’s the resident mechanic, who comes out shouting at Mando not to hurt her droids, and then admonishes him for the state of his ship. This is Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris) and she’s great.

Mando
Peli Motto CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
After Mando and Peli reach some kind of deal on ship repairs, he takes off, leaving a sleeping baby Yoda on the ship. When the Kid gets up, Peli at first thinks it’s something dangerous on board, but when she realizes it’s just a baby she scoops him up in her arms. She’ll watch the Kid while Mando is away, and charge him extra for it.

In the cantina, Mando looks for work but the droid at the bar tells him there’s none to be found. No guild work and nothing off the books either. Fortunately for Mando, he’s not the only non-guild bounty hunter in the bar.

This is Toro Calican (Jake Cannavale) and he’s sitting in the same table where Han Solo shot and killed Greedo. (We won’t get into who shot first).

Mando
Jake Cannavale as Toro Calican CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
Toro tells Mando he has a valuable bounty that he’s willing to share for some help. He’s looking for Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) an assassin who was employed by both crime syndicates (including the Hutts) and the Empire.

It turns out, Toro isn’t yet a member of the bounty hunter’s guild, and this bounty will be his ticket in. Mando can have all the money. Toro is just looking for a way into the guild. Mando is hesitant even still. Fennec is not someone you trifle with. She’s a hardened killer and even more deadly backed into a corner.

But he needs the money, so he tells Toro to get two speeder bikes and meet him in thirty minutes back at the shop.

Mando heads back and finds Peli holding the Kid. They’re both asleep and Mando, in his panic at seeing the Kid’s bed empty, wakes them both with his hollering. She explains that he can’t just leave a baby alone like that and that she’s been watching him out of the goodness of her heart.

Baby Yoda
The Child CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
They both go outside where Toro is waiting with the speeder bikes, and the young bounty hunter in-training glimpses the Kid. He doesn’t think anything of it, but that moment plays a critical role later in the episode.

Off they go into the desert, speeding over the dunes and having what looks to be a lot of fun. I mean, I’d ride hovering speeder bikes over sand dunes any day.

They find another bounty hunter being dragged behind a large dewback, dead as a doornail. That’s when Fennec starts shooting, firing her sniper rifle from a distant ridge. Mando only makes it to safety thanks to that good old beskar steel.

They wait until night to take her on, relying on flash-flares to blind her as they speed across the sand. It’s a good plan, and it almost works, but Mando’s speeder is taken out and then he’s hit full-square in the chest. Saved by the beskar again. Still, if Toro hadn’t been able to sneak up behind Fennec, she would have taken him out with her next shot.

A fight ensues and Fennec very nearly gets the better of Toro. He’s bigger than her, but she’s the better fighter. Mando shows up just in time and it’s all over. Fennec is cuffed and they head back to the one functioning speeder bike.

Mando

Mando wants Toro to go find the dewback so they can all have a ride, but Toro doesn’t trust leaving him alone with their quarry, so Mando heads off on foot. While he’s gone, Fennec tries to turn Toro against him. She tells him about the scuffle on Nevarro and the rogue Mandalorian who made off with the asset. She tells him the asset was a kid, and that’s when he knows she’s telling the truth.

Fennec wants Toro to free her. They can work together to take out the Mandalorian, she says. And he seems to agree, walking up slowly to her to take off her cuffs. Then he shoots her in the stomach. He tells her she’s right—bringing in Mando will be the bigger prize, more glory. But letting her go would be the death of him. And in any case, he doesn’t really need her anymore. I guess there’s truly no honor among thieves, bounty hunters and assassins.

Mando returns to Peli’s shop where, unsurprisingly enough, Toro has both her and the Child held hostage. Toro tells him to drop the gun, which he does, and then has him put his hands behind his back. He orders Peli to go cuff him, and she sees that he’s holding one of the flash-flares he used on Fennec earlier. “You’re smarter than you look,” she whispers.

Mando tosses the flare, grabs his blaster and flanks Toro. By the time the young bounty hunter realizes his mistake, it’s too late. Mando shoots first and Toro is no more. There’s a brief moment of worry when baby Yoda is nowhere to be found, but then he emerges from behind some crates without a scratch. Peli picks him up and tells him that she knows all those loud noises are hard on his big ears.

Mando didn’t get paid for Fennec, but he manages to get Toro’s credits and, I assume, whatever the other unnamed bounty hunter had on him. He pays Peli handsomely and off they go.

There’s a final shot of some mysterious person approaching Fennec’s body and kneeling down beside her, but we don’t see who it is or what happens next. The credits role and we’re left to wonder until next Friday.

(Side-note: Episode 6 airs next Friday, the 13th—Friday the 13th!—but Episode 7 airs the following Wednesday. That’s important because it means it comes out very purposefully ahead of the release of Star Wars: Rise Of Skywalker. Pretty curious to see how the film and TV show are tied together, even if it’s in a subtle way.

I read some absolute garbage about baby Yoda being “able to defeat Palpatine” which is just the most egregious nonsense. Baby Yoda is fifty years old right now. He wouldn’t be even twice that age by the time we meet Rey and Finn since that timeline is just one generation later. In other words, the Child will almost certainly still be a child in thirty or forty years, though maybe like a four or five-year-old.)

Verdict
Another fun episode of The Mandalorian with that perfect mix of humor, action and Star Wars goodies. Pedro Pascal continues to impress with his ability to convey so much using so little. He really has the gunslinger role down, and plays the loner silent type so well.

I loved all the fan-service and the return to one of the most important fictional planets ever created. We even got to see Tuskan raiders—without it turning into a fight.

When Mando and Toro are speeding through the desert they spot some Tuskan raiders near some banthas. Toro scouts them through his monocular, talking about how the locals scorn the Tuskan people. Mando points out that the Tuskans consider themselves the only real locals. We continue with the Western theme in this regard, with Tuskans playing the part of the Native American and Mando as the sympathetic gunslinger.

Then suddenly two of them are right behind Toro, seemingly out of nowhere.

A New Hope

It’s a hilarious nod nod to Luke’s own first encounter with the sand people. He’s using macrobinoculars when they show up out of the blue behind him. But instead of fighting—no droids were harmed, no young men brained—the encounter is a peaceful one.

Mando negotiates with them using their sign language, and ends up buying safe passage for the low cost of Toro’s monocular.

In any case, it’s moments like these that make this show so great. I loved every minute of ‘The Gunslinger’ and I can’t wait for the final three episodes. I just wish we had more to look forward to. Three more (rather short) episodes is just not enough!
‘The Mandalorian’ Episode 6 Recap And Review: ‘The Prisoner’ Is More ‘Star Wars’ Gold

Mandalorian Episode 6
'The Mandalorian' offers up one of its most intense episodes yet in 'The Prisoner.' CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
The Mandalorian continues its excellent run in its sixth episode ‘The Prisoner.’ The show continues to be a surprise procedural action show which makes it rather at odds with mainstream TV these days.

Shows like Game of Thrones, The Handmaid’s Tale, The Walking Dead and many others tend to push the main narrative forward each week, and while more contained stories do take place within each episode, they usually build from one episode to the next.

In The Mandalorian, characters are introduced never to be seen again almost every single episode. Other than the Child and Mando (Pedro Pascal), every other character we’ve met has either been killed or left behind after one or two episodes. Greef Karga, The Armorer, Kuill, The Client and Dr. Pershing have all been in just two episodes. Other characters like Cara Dune, IG-11, Omera and so forth have only showed up for one.

Today In: Innovation
I think it’s honestly kind of a nice change of pace from all the other TV out there. It reminds me of The X-File’s “monster of the week” episodes. You knew there was bigger stuff going on with the Cigarette Smoking man and all the conspiracy stuff, but you could just focus on Scully and Mulder figuring out a mystery.

In The Mandalorian, Mando and the Child are on the run and so each week they’re either seeking out sanctuary or looking for work to keep the Razor Crest fueled and running (mostly). So instead of a crew of characters we come to know over time, Mando only stays in any one place briefly, and we are left to hope that somehow some of these characters—both good and bad—make a return later on.

It’s an interesting, bold way to film a TV show in 2019 and not everyone is in love with it—my colleague Paul Tassi for instance, finds it too formulaic. I disagree, though I do wish we had some of these characters stick around longer.

In ‘The Prisoner’ the formula holds, with Mando meeting a group of mercenaries on a space station who need his ship and his help to rescue one of their number from a New Republic prison ship. We’re introduced to his old acquaintance Ranzar Malk, aka Ran (Mark Boone Jr) who runs the station and the mercenaries and who used to do jobs with Mando back in the good ol’ days.

The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
He sends Mando off with a violent crew comprised of an ex-Imperial sharp-shooter named Mayfeld (Bill Burr) a Devaronian bruiser named Burg (played by an almost unrecognizable Clancy Brown), a droid pilot named Zero (Richard Ayoade) and Mando’s old fling, a Twi'lek woman named Xi'an (played by an almost unrecognizable Natalia Tena).

This is not a very nice group of thugs and killers. Mayfeld is proud and prickly, eager to show Mando who’s boss. His dislike for Mando starts immediately when Ran tells the Mandalorian that he’s an ex-Imperial sharpshooter. “That’s not saying much,” Mando says drily. “Hey, I wasn’t a Stormtrooper!” Mayfeld hollers back. It’s a pretty funny little Stormtrooper joke.

Xi’an holds an old grudge toward Mando, and even if she didn’t she’s all spite and swagger, baring her pointy teeth at every opportunity, flashing her knives.

Burg is the most bristling of the bunch, and he and Mando come to blows before they even reach the prison galley. Mayfeld stops them, but in the process they accidentally open the door to the Child’s room.

Baby Yoda
The Child aka Baby Yoda CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
The conversation up to this point revolved around Mando’s helmet. Mayfeld tells him that in order to trust him, they need to see his face. Mando replies in stoic fashion by saying nothing, so Mayfeld gives Burg a nod and that’s when the fight ensues.

The mercenaries were obnoxious enough before, but they become downright unbearable when they find the Child. Mayfeld picks him up, and I don’t know about you but I was on the edge of my seat. The threat is very real at this point, and in close quarters with baby Yoda, I’m not sure Mando could take all three at once. That’s not even taking into account Zero up above piloting the ship (much to Mando’s chagrin).

It’s Zero who saves the day, in a sense, by landing rather abruptly atop the New Republic ship. Everyone is jolted around and Mayfeld, the accursed bastard, drops the Child. Mando places himself above his little companion protectively.

When the dust settles, they’ve apparently made it to the ship unnoticed thanks to the Razor Crest being off the grid and some masterful piloting on Zero’s part. Mando opens the seal to the New Republic vessel while Xi’an and Mayfeld talk conspiratorially nearby. We don’t hear what they say, but it can’t be good and it’s definitely about Mando.

The New Republic ship is supposed to be manned entirely by droids, but after they fight their way through some droid sentries—with Mando doing pretty much all the fighting—they find a lone human piloting the ship in the control room. Man, that can’t be a very pleasant job, all by yourself hauling dangerous criminals across the galaxy with only sentry droids for companions. No thank you.

The New Republic pilot is played by Matt Lanter, the voice actor who plays Anakin Skywalker in The Clone Wars animated series. That’s a fun bit of trivia. The unnamed soldier is killed by Xi’an, very much against Mando’s wishes, but manages to set off a distress beacon. That means the mercenaries only have twenty minutes to rescue the prisoner and get away before New Republic forces arrive.

The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
They find the cell the prisoner is in and open it, revealing none other than Qin, Xi’an’s brother, who also has an old grudge with Mando, and is just as nasty and unpleasant as his sister. He steps out, and the others shove Mando in, shutting the cell door and laughing as they hurry off. It’s not only a seriously cheap move, it reminds us that the Child is up there in the ship still, and if Mando’s left in a prison cell, he’ll be at the mercy of these scummy criminals. No doubt they’d figure out the bounty soon enough and happily turn him over to the Client (Werner Herzog).

Fortunately, Mando is too clever and resourceful to be kept behind bars. He snags a passing sentry droid with his little grappling hook and rips its arm off, blaster and all. He blasts the droid and uses its arm—which has a scomp link—to unlock the cell door. Then he hurries to the control room and puts the ship on lockdown. Hallway emergency doors come sliding down. The lights turn red. Zero informs them that he’s escaped.

Xi’an and Burg head off to find and kill Mando (I told you we should have ended him, she hisses at Mayfeld) while Qin tells Mayfeld he’ll pay him extra if he gets him off the ship.

“What about your sister?” Mayfeld asks.

“What about her?” Qin replies, walking off.

“Nice family,” Mayfeld mutters. Yeah, no kidding.

Nothing goes very well for these poor bastards. Burg almost kills Mando in a pretty brutal fight in the control room in which we discover that Burg is also fire-proof, but Mando uses his door trick and crushes the brute to the floor. He’s so strong, however, that he starts to lift the door back up. Thankfully this room is doubled-sealed and a second pair of doors shuts on the Devaronian.

The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
Mando almost sneaks up on Xi’an but she notices him just in time and starts throwing her knives at him. She’s good at it, too, but Mando is better—and much better armored. Two down, two to go.

Mayfeld shoots through some droids, proving his sharpshooter chops, but Mando sneaks up behind him easily enough. Three down.

Mando finds Qin just starting to crawl up the ladder to the ship. Qin tries to get the draw on him but, predictably enough, fails. He does manage to convince Mando to take him back to Ran, however, citing Mando’s honor and the importance of finishing a job, and promising him extra cash for his efforts.

While all this was going on, the Child had taken a trip up to the cockpit only to find Zero, who had been busy snooping and digging up intel on Mando and the Guild. Apparently the Force clues baby Yoda into the droid’s intentions, because when he turns around—rifle in hand—the kid is gone.

What follows is a very tense game of hide-and-seek that manages to both make us incredibly nervous and have us cooing over the Child’s adorableness. You thought baby Yoda was cute sipping bone broth? Well go watch him hide from a wicked droid. That’s cuteness to the max.

Zero finds him in the end and inexplicably raises his rifle to shoot. I’m not sure why he wants to kill this poor little creature, but his intentions are clear. The Child raises his hand, squints his eyes, and prepares once again to use the Force. And for the second time, Mando blasts a droid about to kill the little guy. He shows up just in the nick of time, though I wonder . . . would the Child have been able to protect himself? I’m not sure. He was able to stop the mudhorn on Nevarro, but only momentarily.

We’ll never know. Mando flies them back to Ran’s base where he delivers Qin. Ran pays up and Mando flies off. “Kill him,” Ran says, and a gun-ship prepares to launch. I guess Mando really stopped at the wrong space port this time.

But it turns out the joke’s on Ran and Qin. Mando had pocketed the distress beacon and surrepticiously placed it on Qin. When the New Republic X-Wings arrive, they see the gun-ship starting to launch and they open fire, destroying the base and presumably killing all the horrible people still on it.

At least their fate was quick. I’m not sure what’s going to happen to Xi’an, Mayfeld and Burg. Mando spared them, but left them locked in a cell on a prison ship with no pilot or personnel—nobody to feed them, in other words, or bring them water or get them to any kind of destination. With the distress beacon gone, no New Republic ships will be arriving any time soon. If they do manage to avoid starvation, they’re now prisoners of the New Republic and will be for a very, very long time indeed.

Verdict

The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
Once again, a highly entertaining, very enjoyable episode. I liked it more than last week’s ‘The Gunslinger’ which, while still fine overall, lacked some of the energy that other episodes this season have been near to bursting with.

I like that we’re getting so many different alien species, both new and old, in this show. Same with droids. So much variety really gives a sense of the galaxy’s scope, and we’re just in the Outer Rim planets.

The show continues to ooze that Star Wars feel in every small detail, from the ship’s navigation system to the evil Twi’leks. Other details, like Mando handing the Child his one little toy, help give humanity and character to our hero.

I do hope that in the final two episodes we start to push the story forward. After several misadventures and run-ins with various unsavory characters, it’s time to figure out what comes next. Will Mando go to the New Republic? Seems unlikely. Will he go to the source of the bounty and take out the Client or whoever the Client is working for? Perhaps.

Or maybe that mysterious figure from last week’s episode—most likely Giancarlo Esposito’s Moff Gideon—will catch up with Mando. I’m not sure, but something has to happen to lead us to a satisfying season finale. There needs to be a build-up next week and then a resolution—or cliffhanger—in episode 8.

Speaking of which, next week’s episode airs on a Wednesday. That’s because of the theatrical release of Star Wars Episode IX: Rise Of Skywalker the following evening. (Officially Friday, but theaters will be showing the movie Thursday evening as well). So there may be some connection, though I expect if there is it will be small.

No, baby Yoda will not be the surprise hero of Rise of Skywalker as some are musing. He will still be very young and there’s no way they’re going to introduce that kind of deus ex machina this late in the game—though hopefully the story of the Child will continue beyond The Mandalorian.

The Mandalorian Chapter 7

The penultimate episode of the first season of The Mandalorian ends in tragedy. But not before a tense, action-packed episode that brought back many characters from earlier in the show.

Mando (Pedro Pascal) has been offered clemency by Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) the leader of the bounty hunters guild on Nevarro. The Client (Werner Herzog) has apparently cracked down, imposing some form of Imperial rule over the city and making it very hard for Karga and his bounty hunters to do business.

So Karga offers Mando a deal: Come back and take out the Client and you get to keep the Child and have your record in the guild scrubbed. Karga gets to run business as usual, and Mando can stop running from the Client and the myriad hunters he’s sent after him.

The question is, can Mando trust Karga to keep his end of the bargain? Could this be a trap? “I have no choice,” Mando tells Cara Dune (Gina Carano) when he heads back to Sorgan to ask for her help. She doesn’t like the idea but when she learns he wants to take out an Imperial official, she says she’s in.

But they need to find someone to help watch The Child. They decide this after he almost crashes the Razor Crest while Mando and Cara Dune are belowdecks. I’m not entirely sure, but I get the feeling the Child didn’t want to go back to Nevarro and was throwing a bit of a tantrum. Either that, or he was just being a curious toddler.

So Mando heads back to Arvala-7 where he found baby Yoda in the first place. He wants to hire Kuiil (Nick Nolte / Misty Rosas) to help protect the child and eventually convinces him to come. But Kuiil will only do so if he can bring IG-11 (Taika Waititi / Rio Hackford) along with him. And his Blurgs.

“I have spoken,” he says gruffly.

Kuiil found the ruined shell of IG-11 back where Mando had left the droid for dead. Because he’s a kind and resourceful man, Kuiil fixed the droid and reprogrammed him and essentially did physical therapy with him until he was back in fighting shape—only now he’s not a hunter droid at all, and serves Kuiil peacefully in his newly peaceful valley.

Alas for Kuiil, he agrees to leave peace behind and go help Mando protect the Child. They set off—Mando, Cara Dune, Kuiil, IG-11, three Blurgs and one baby Yoda. When they make it to Nevarro, Mando insists that IG-11 stay on the ship, a questionable call that has its consequences. His dislike for droids is brought up on more than one occasion, but instead of admitting to disliking all droids, Mando insists it’s just this one he doesn’t trust. We know better.

They meet Greef Karga and three of his hunters on Nevarro, and you can tell Karga is a little taken aback that Mando has brought his own muscle (and beasts). He tells them that they’ll camp outside the city and head in to meet with (and kill) the Client at first light.

“Nothing can go wrong,” Karga says over the fire, just as a huge, winged creature lurches down from the sky and gashes Karga’s arm. More of the winged beasts descend from the darkness. They’re powerful beasts—one lifts a Blurg right off the ground and flies away with it. One of Karga’s hunters is taken also before they manage to drive the dragon-like creatures away with blasters and Mando’s flamethrower.

Karga is badly injured. His arm is gashed almost to shreds, and Cara Dune moves quickly to tend to the wound. The real danger is the poison, however, and it’s spreading. Nobody has an antidote.

And that’s when we see the Child approach. “Get this thing out of here,” Cara Dune says, as baby Yoda raises his arm to the wound. “Wait!” Kuiil urges. The Child places his hand on the wound and a delirious Karga cries out, “He’s trying to eat me!”

The Child’s face scrunches up into a look of intense concentration and the Karga’s look of pain disappears. So do the gashes on his arm. Everyone looks on in wonder.

I’m pretty sure this is the first time we’ve seen Force Healing onscreen, though it is part of the wider Star Wars Extended Universe, and now even though the books are no longer canon, Force Healing is once again thanks to its inclusion here. It’s a pretty incredible moment, and a much more powerful use of the Force than baby Yoda’s mudhorn levitation.

The Mandalorian

It’s also a powerful enough gesture that Greef Karga has a change of heart. As they look down on the Imperial-occupied city the next day, we see his two remaining hunters pull out their blasters behind Mando and his companions.

Karga is in front, and he spins around suddenly, two blasters drawn. He makes short work of his own men and then comes clean. It was all a trap from the beginning, but now he wants to help Mando help the Child. He can’t let baby Yoda go to some Imperial monster.

So Kuiil takes the Child back on his Blurg to the Razor Crest while Mando, Cara Dune and Greef Karga take an empty floating crib into the belly of the beast. The city is crawling with Stormtroopers and other ex-Imperial troops. They meet The Client at the cantina.

Werner Herzog remains absolutely creepy as hell, taunting Mando about his Beskar steel and asking why the Mandalorians didn’t simply cede to Imperial rule. The Empire, he says, makes every system they occupy better, more peaceful and prosperous. Compare that to the lawlessness we have now, he tells our hero. Mando, characteristically enough, has no witty retort. The Client asks to see the asset, but Karga tells him that he’s sleeping—a rather lame excuse that ought to immediately raise suspicion.

But then The Client gets a call. It’s from (finally!) Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and the Client, who we discover is actually working for this man, tells him they have the asset but he’s sleeping. “Are you certain of that?” Gideon replies, and then the blasters start blasting. A big hole appears in the middle of the Client’s chest. The Stormtroopers in the cantina are taken down quickly, but Mando and company quickly discover the odds are even worse than they expected.

Outside the blasted up cantina we see a row of Stormtroopers all in black. They’re quickly joined by dozens of regular Stormtroopers. Then a TIE fighter appears, landing slowly outside the cantina and Gideon emerges from inside.

Just before the TIE fighter appears, Mando calls Kuiil over this com-link and tells him to hurry back to the ship and lock it down. But two of the Scout troopers outside intercept the message and blast off in pursuit. Unfortunately, speeder bikes are much faster than Blurgs.

Gideon emerges from his ship and tells Mando that he has no idea how badly he wants the asset or what the The Child actually means in the bigger scheme of things. Neither do we, of course, but we have an idea.

Earlier in the episode, Mando and Cara Dune are arm-wrestling, and poor baby Yoda thinks his dad is in trouble. He thinks they’re actually fighting and, perhaps wanting only to stop the fight, force chokes Dune. It’s kind of shocking, but if you think about it it also makes a certain amount of sense. He’s just a toddler, and while he has innate Force abilities, he doesn’t really know when to use each of them appropriately. One minute he might be healing an enemy and the next Force choking a friend. He’s a loaded gun, in many respects, if also the most adorable loaded gun you’ve ever seen.

Imagine what practitioners of the Dark Side of the Force might be able to do with The Child. Could they turn him to the Dark Side since he’s so young, moulding him to their will? At the very least, they could destroy him, preventing another powerful Yoda-like figure from emerging sometime in the future.

Whatever Gideon wants with The Child, it can’t be good. And that’s what makes the end of this episode so painful. We see Kuiil reach the ship and the gangplank come open. Mando is hissing into the com-link “Kuiil do you copy?” We see the Scout troopers in hot pursuit.

Then we see The Child, swaddled in blue, laying alone on the sand. A Scout trooper speeds by and scoops the creature up. The camera pans to Kuiil, almost certainly dead along with his Blurg, blasted just before he could reach safety.

Mando, Karga and Cara Dune are pinned down in the cantina with an overwhelming force of enemies outside led by a formidable new chief bad guy. Baby Yoda has been captured. Kuiil is dead. The credits role and now we have to wait nine whole days to see what happens.

Verdict

The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
One thing I loved about this episode is how it tied things back to what came before. Kuiil isn’t just abandoned after the first few episodes, he returns—tragically—to lend his service to his friend and to baby Yoda.

Cara Dune, who Mando finds fighting for money back on Sorgan, didn’t seem like she’d be a one-episode character. For all the worries about this show being too much of a procedural, now we have Mando circling back to find help from the friends he’s made along the way.

And now we’re thrust directly headlong back into the overarching plot of this season. Mando can no longer run and keep running, he realizes. They’ll just keep coming for him. So he has to take risk and fight the Imps head-on. It’s just a plan that hasn’t gone terribly well so far.

I’ll be honest, Moff Gideon is going to need to pull out all the villainy stoppers to top The Client. Herzog’s bad guy was just oozing villain. He’s going to be a hard act to follow.

I will also say, I happily have no idea what’s going to happen in the season finale, other than me becoming super bummed out that it’s over for lord knows how long. The Mandalorian has been a surprise treat, with The Child emerging as one of the most adorable things I’ve ever seen on TV—though, as today’s episode has taught us, not without his own special kind of danger.

As I noted last week, I didn’t mind the self-contained episodes of the past few seasons. We met interesting new characters, found ourselves in interesting new places and Mando faced some kind of new threat each week that led to cool action sequences and a growing bond between the bounty hunter and his new baby pet.

But I am very glad that this week returned to the larger story and gave those past episodes more meaning in the process. Now we just need Mando to bring everything he has and then some to get The Child back.

This is the way.

The Mandalorian Finale
'The Mandalorian' finishes out its first season with a powerful season finale, and just a few ... [+] CREDIT: DISNEY/LUCASFILM
The Mandalorian’s first season has come to an end, sadly, after just eight short episodes. Today’s season finale was the longest of the bunch, though still just over 40 minutes of runtime.

That’s fine, of course. It’s not how long an episode is that matters, it’s how well the story plays out, and how the creators make use of the time. They make (mostly) brilliant use of it here. This was a tremendous season finale with a huge reveal at the end, and just a handful of things that bugged me.

The episode opens up where last week’s left off. Our heroes are stuck inside the blown out cantina with Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his shiny stormtrooper battalion outside, hopelessly outnumbered. Gideon’s men roll out a new weapon that they call an “e-web” or some such, and he gives them until dark to surrender. He knows all their names, including Mando’s true identity: Din Djarin. He knows all of this because he was an instrumental officer in the destruction of Mandalore and the Mandalorian people. But he also knows who Mando’s companions are.

Today In: Innovation
Meanwhile, the two scout-troopers who killed Kuiil (Nick Nolte) last week (those bastards) pull up just outside of town to await orders. Whoever they’re speaking with over the comlink tells them to wait—Gideon has just killed a whole unit of his own men, and there’s obviously some confusion about what’s to be done.

So the two troopers, voiced by Jason Sudeikis and Adam Pally, lounge around and wait. When the Child makes a noise, they punch him. Later, when he bites one of them, they punch him again. At this point, we know they’re done for, we just don’t know how.

How To “Solve” Data Breaches: With Response, Not Just Prevention
The Mandalorian
Scout Troopers CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
It’s a funny scene other than the Child abuse, which had my blood boiling. They take turns shooting at some junk nearby and miss every shot. It’s another great dig at the lousy aim of Stormtroopers, though that raises some questions later in the episode.

Then IG-11 (Taika Waititi who also directed) shows up and demands that they hand over the Child. He’s a nurse-droid now, and it’s his prime directive to protect baby Yoda. The scout troopers tell him to beat it and he kills the crap out of them. They never stood a chance.

Back in the cantina, Mando (Pedro Pascal) tries again to get hold of Kuiil but gets nothing . . . until we hear the gleeful shriek of the Child on the other end. We see IG-11 speeding across the lava flats with baby Yoda tucked in front of him.

“What did you do?” Mando asks, accusatorily.

“I fulfilled my prime directive,” IG-11 responds.

“Which is?”

“To protect the Child,” the droid replies, and we see him speeding not toward the Razor Crest, but toward the city. He blasts his way past the guards at the gate, then descends upon the unwitting Stormtroopers along the streets. It’s a thrilling action sequence. Cara Dune (Gina Carano) peers outside the cantina and sees explosions down the street. The legion of Stormtroopers turn to face this incoming threat.

Baby Yoda
The Child CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
Our heroes take the opportunity to go on the offensive. Cara, Mando and Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) start firing. Mando and Karga leave the building while Dune covers them from inside. IG-11 speeds into the square and leaps off the speeder, letting it explode in the midst of the Imperials. With baby Yoda still strapped to him, the fight begins in earnest.

Moff Gideon takes it all in stride. He calmly watches as his men are killed around him. (Side-note: Why do Stormtroopers even bother wearing armor?) Then he takes aim and pings Mando in the head. It only knocks him back a step or two. So Gideon trains his blaster on the “eweb” power block and fires. It explodes and sends Mando to the ground.

Dune fights her way out of the cantina and drags Mando back to safety. IG-11 and Karga follow, and once again they’re pinned inside. While IG-11 burns through the sewer grate, Gideon sends a fire-trooper to burn them out of the building. He sets the cantina on fire and then lumbers through the doorway, training his flamethrower on our heroes.

This is baby Yoda’s moment to shine. He squints his eyes raises up his tiny little hands and stops the fire. Karga and Cara Dune look on in wonder. Then the Child throws the fire back at the trooper and he goes boom.

IG-11 gets through the grate and Cara Dune tries to get Mando to leave with them, but he tells her to leave him. He’s done for. He can buy them some time. So IG-11 gives her the baby and says he’ll stay with Mando. The others escape into the tunnels below and IG-11 goes to take off Mando’s helmet. It’s the only way he can heal him, since he’s bleeding from the head.

Mando tells him that if he tries it he’ll kill him. He made a vow to never let another living thing see his face. “I am not a living thing,” IG-11 reminds him, and off goes the helmet. We finally see the man behind the mask. Pedro Pascal finally gets to show audiences his bloodied face, if only for a moment.

IG-11 heals him, though he says it will take hours for him to fully recover, and the two meet up with Cara Dune and Greef Karga, along with the Child, below.

They make their way through the tunnels and finally come to the Mandalorian Covert, only to find a heaping pile of Mandalorian helmets and the place deserted. The only survivor is the Armorer (Emily Swallow) who tells them that Imperials showed up after the fight with the bounty hunters and wiped them out. This is where I find myself having some quibbles about the episode, because things just don’t add up.

Mando and the Armorer CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
How did the Imperials defeat that many Mandalorians? We’ve already seen how ineffective they are against Mando and his tiny crew. I have a hard time understanding how they’d be caught so flat-footed. And if the Imperials came in numbers and strength enough to defeat the entire Mandalorian covert, why didn’t they remain on Navarro?
How did the Armorer survive while the rest of the Mandalorians were killed? It seems like they’d all be dead, unless she was out shopping or something.
Why didn’t the Imperials take all that priceless Beskar steel with them afterward? If they wiped them all out, they’d have no reason not to gather it all up.
So this all kind of bugged me, though not so much that I couldn’t enjoy the rest of the episode. I have other quibbles that I’ll address further on. For now, I just wish they’d handled this differently. Maybe had the Mandalorians just gone except for the Armorer. Maybe they scattered after the fight and set off to create their fort elsewhere.

Mando speaks with the Armorer and we learn more of his backstory through flashbacks. We see, once again, his parents hiding him on whatever world he hails from. It turns out he wasn’t born on Mandalore and this isn’t a flashback of that planet’s destruction. His parents hide him and the battle droid is about to kill him when it’s blasted to smithereens. A Mandalorian appears, and beckons for Mando—or Din at this point—to come with him. He does, and outside we see a whole group of Mandalorians taking on the Imperial droids, rescuing the people of the town. The one that saves Mando jetpacks off with him.

“I was a foundling,” Mando says. The Armorer tells him that the Child is a foundling also, and that they are now bound together, that he is now baby Yoda’s father, at least until he can reunite him with his own kind. The Armorer tells him that she knows of his kind—a tribe of sorcerers known as Jedi that once fought against the great Mandalore.

The Armorer gives Mando his very first jetpack and his signet—a Mudhorn. She tells him that he and the Child are now a clan of two.

And so our second season is setup. Mando is on a quest to find the Child’s people—either more of his species or, perhaps, other Jedi. This opens up some fascinating possibilities and adventures.

But the Imperials are still coming, so our heroes make good their escape, following the tunnels to the lava river where they find an ancient-looking craft perched above the molten lava with a burned out ferry droid that looks a lot like R2-D2 sitting in it.

They manage to get the ship moving and the droid blinks to life—and then stands up. It’s like R2-D2 but with long arms and legs, and a great long pole to push the ferry down the lava river with. There’s light at the end of the tunnel, but Mando—using his helmets special x-ray vision—spots Stormtroopers waiting in ambush.

A whole platoon, he says, and here is my second big quibble:

There are maybe two dozen Stormtroopers waiting outside in ambush. That’s fewer than we encountered in the town, and yet Mando and the rest all see the coming fight as hopeless. Have they not seen how poorly a Stormtrooper shoots? This shouldn’t be that difficult a fight.
And yet, IG-11 goes ahead and self-destructs, blowing up the lot of them, despite this not being the overwhelming odds that the show wants us to believe it is. They should have included many more Stormtroopers or some other danger, because I was not convinced at all.
The Mandalorian
Moff Gideon CREDIT: DISNEY / LUCASFILM
So IG-11 dies a second time and it hardly seems fair. Then again, he was a tiny bit over-powered. That works in a fun fight scene or two, but would suck the fun out of the show fairly quickly if he just kept destroying everything in his path.

They emerge from the lava tunnel only to see Moff Gideon’s TIE Fighter fast-approaching. His first assault misses, but he circles back for another. “Our blasters are useless,” Cara cries out. “Tell him to do the magic hands!” Karga says, and makes the “magic hands” sign at baby Yoda, who smiles and waves back at him.

“I have a plan,” Mando says. He isn’t fully trained with one yet, but he straps the jetpack to his back nonetheless, and off he goes, bursting after the TIE Fighter once it makes its second pass (and misses again).

He uses his grappling hook to latch on to the TIE Fighter and then reels himself in and tries to blast his way through the hatch. Gideon tilts the TIE Fighter abruptly and Mando almost loses his grip. He manages to stick an explosive to the arm that connects the cockpit to the TIE Fighter’s wing before falling off.

Gideon realizes his predicament too late and the bomb goes off, sending the Imperial villain crashing to the ground.

And so our heroes win the day. Greef Karga decides to stay on Navarro to get the bounty hunter guild going again, and he welcomes back Mando with open arms. Cara Dune decides to stay as well, hoping to mop up whatever Imperial presence remains on the planet. Karga offers her a job.

Mando and the Child head back to their ship and blast off in search of baby Yoda’s people. Mando had given Cara Dune his Mandalorian necklace when he tried to send them on with him, and he discovers that the Child is wearing it, sucking on the little Beskar steel piece the way baby’s do. It’s the symbol of the Mythosaur’s skull, the giant creatures the Mandalorians once rode upon.

“Why don’t you hang on to this,” Mando says, and now baby Yoda has two toys.

Of course, that’s not the end. We know that Moff Gideon can’t be dead just yet. Not that quickly and not that easily. And sure enough, we find ourselves back at the crash site. Jawas are already picking the TIE Fighter clean when suddenly we see something cutting through the ship’s cockpit. It looks . . . like a lightsaber.

Moff Gideon emerges holding a glowing black blade. It’s not a lightsaber, after all. It’s the Darksaber! There’s a whole huge long history of the Darksaber, which was created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian to be inducted in to the Jedi Order. It changed hands numerous times, even falling into the possession of Darth Maul at one point. Its last known owner was female Mandalorian, Bo-Katan Kryze. Somehow it has now come into the hands of Moff Gideon.

That’s quite a way to end the first season of the first live-action Star Wars show! I mean, think about just how much cool stuff happened in this short, eight-episode season. We follow a Mandalorian bounty hunter who just wants to do his job but stumbles across a baby Yoda in the first episode! By the end of the finale, we learn that the new Big Bad is in possession of one of the coolest, most fascinating swords in the entire Star Wars universe. We actually get to see a Darksaber in live-action! How cool is that?

This episode had a few missteps, which I’ve detailed above. I also didn’t really like the bit where Cara Dune says she doesn’t really do the baby thing when she’s handed the Child, if only because she had the Child earlier and held him without complaint. But overall, this was a thrilling, action-packed episode with yet another incredibly cool reveal.

Season 2 has been set up, though I’m not sure if Mando will really be free and clear of bounty hunters since Gideo is still very much alive. I wish Cara Dune, at the very least, had stuck with Mando on his quest. She’s a great character and it would be nice if some of these characters stuck around for more than just an episode or two. Oh well.

What did you think? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook. Now begins the very long, agonizing wait for Season 2.
